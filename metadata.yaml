summary: '"Fashions for Men and The Swan: Two Plays by Franz Molnár" by Ferenc Molnár
  is a collection of dramatic works written in the early 20th century. The first play,
  "Fashions for Men," revolves around the interactions in a clothing shop, exploring
  themes of societal class and personal relationships. The characters include Peter
  Juhasz, his wife Adele, and various customers, highlighting the nuances of human
  emotions and social dynamics in a lighthearted yet poignant manner.  At the start
  of the play "Fashions for Men," we find ourselves in a modest shop, where Peter
  Juhasz and his wife Adele work together amidst an array of customers, each seeking
  to fulfill their fashion desires. As interactions unfold, there''s an undercurrent
  of tension as Adele grapples with important decisions, including a growing connection
  to Oscar, one of her husband''s colleagues. The opening sets the stage for a comedic
  yet serious exploration of relationships, revealing the complexities of loyalty
  and desire against the backdrop of social expectations. (This is an automatically
  generated summary.)'
