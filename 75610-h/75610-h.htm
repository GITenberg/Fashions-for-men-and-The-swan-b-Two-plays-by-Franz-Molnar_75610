<h4>ACT ONE</h4>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Scene</span>—<i>A little shop. Down left is the display window;
up left the entrance from the street; between
the two a cashier’s desk with a cash register
upon it. There is a counter along the
back wall and another along the right wall with
shelves behind them and, over them, a little
balcony.</i></p>

<p class="noindent"><i>A broad space between the counters leads
through an archway up right to a rear room
of the establishment. Before the window down
left stands a table, displaying open boxes of
cravats, suspenders, ladies’ girdles, colored
scarfs and bottles of perfume. Near it stands
a rack of walking-sticks. There are two stools
in front of each counter.</i></p>

<p class="noindent"><i>It is evening. <span class="smcap">Adele</span> sits behind the cashier’s
desk. <span class="smcap">Oscar</span> stands behind the counter at
back speaking in low tones to the <span class="smcap">Unassuming
Lady</span>, who sits on a stool facing him across a
heap of merchandise on the counter. <span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>
stands in front of the counter at right, waiting
on the <span class="smcap">Aristocratic Lady</span>, who sits on one of
the stools with an assortment of summer-weight
material for blouses before her.</i></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aristocratic Lady</span>—If I remember rightly, Mr.
Juhasz, I saw some of this on Countess Hohensperg
at Tatralomnicz.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—That may be. I must look it up in the
book. [<i>To <span class="smcap">Adele</span>.</i>] Tell me, dear. [<i>Shows her
the material.</i>] Is this the same Agreable we sold
to the Countess Hohensperg a few months ago?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—It may be. I am not sure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—[<i>To the <span class="smcap">Unassuming Lady</span>.</i>] Excuse
me, madame. [<i>Loudly to <span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>.</i>] Yes, the
Countess Hohensperg got some of that....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aristocratic Lady</span>—I thought so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—Yes, madame, this Chatterton Agreable
comes in twelve different colors. The countess took
five.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aristocratic Lady</span>—Then, of course, I can’t consider
it. I am really sorry to give you so much
trouble, Mr. Juhasz.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—But it is no trouble at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aristocratic Lady</span>—You are perfectly charming,
Mr. Juhasz. Just as if you had been born to cater
to the caprices of women. You never lose patience——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Clearing away the materials.</i>] But
that’s what we are here for, madame.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aristocratic Lady</span>—[<i>Rummaging through the
materials.</i>] This is nice, but it isn’t becoming to
me. This is for a bigger woman ... this for a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
thinner woman ... this is too youthful ... and
this is too old. This is nice, but it’s a bit loud ...
and this is too dull. Now this is very nice indeed,
but Countess Hohensperg has it. So it is out of
the question.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Suppose we let the Agreable go, and
look at some Biarritz instead. The fact is, I consider
Biarritz a much better grade. It is kept back
here. Will you step this way, or shall I bring it out
to you here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aristocratic Lady</span>—[<i>Rises.</i>] I wouldn’t think
of putting you to so much trouble. You have
turned out half your stock for me already. [<i>Turns
to <span class="smcap">Adele</span>.</i>] Your wife must be impatient to go
home.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—Not at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aristocratic Lady</span>—It’s past seven. You are
usually closed by this time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—Oh, we are very glad to serve you.
[<i>Points to <span class="smcap">Oscar</span>.</i>] There, you see ... and there
is still another customer in there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—[<i>Has approached <span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>.</i>] The lady
heard us mention the Agreable that Countess Hohensperg——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aristocratic Lady</span>—Quite out of the question!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—No, no—[<i>Low.</i>] The lady heard us
talking about it [<i>meantime <span class="smcap">Juhasz</span> has gone over to
the <span class="smcap">Unassuming Lady</span></i>] and wants to have a look<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
at it. [<i>Takes the material with a pitying smile.</i>]
Thank you. She’s from a different social sphere.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aristocratic Lady</span>—One would never believe that
people could be such apes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>In the archway.</i>] If you will step this
way, please.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aristocratic Lady</span>—I shan’t detain him much
longer, Mrs. Juhasz. [<i><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span> lets her past him,
then follows her off through the archway.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Unassuming Lady</span>—I’ll take this for the sixth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—[<i>Counting the patterns.</i>] One, two,
three, four, five and the Agreable makes six.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Unassuming Lady</span>—Will it take long?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—No, indeed, madame. We know that
madame goes to Lelle on the twentieth, and from
there to Lake Pusztaban, and later to Post Berettyo—Saint
Peter. [<i>The <span class="smcap">Unassuming Lady</span> rises.</i>] Is
there anything else I can show you? We have just
got in some very beautiful girdles. [<i>Reaches for a
box on the table.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Unassuming Lady</span>—Thank you, but it’s too late
now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—But, madame, that’s what we are here for.
[<i>Shows her a bonnet.</i>] Auto bonnets ... just arrived
... really the newest thing of its kind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Unassuming Lady</span>—[<i>Takes it in her hand.</i>] I
shall be coming in again toward the end of next
week.... How much is this?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—May I see? [<i>Looks at the tag.</i>] Seventy
kronen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Unassuming Lady</span>—For this?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—It’s the style that costs, madame. We
have some cheaper ones ... some between forty and
fifty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Unassuming Lady</span>—Thanks.... Next time I
come, perhaps. You have my address?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—[<i>Rapidly.</i>] Forty Nagykorona Street,
first floor, apartment two.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Unassuming Lady</span>—That’s right. Now please
see to it that my things are delivered on time. Good
night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—[<i>Opens the door for her.</i>] You can rely
on us absolutely. Thank you. Good night. [<i>She
exits. He closes the door behind her and returns to
his counter. As he speaks he clears away the materials,
folds up those he sold and makes notes on the
tags.</i>] A couple of evening stars ... those two
... always popping up just as we are about to
close ... and it’s almost impossible to get rid of
them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—Philip is still busy with a customer, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—[<i>Glances through the archway.</i>] And
your husband is just starting to climb the ladder.
[<i>Looks at his watch.</i>] This is a nice time. [<i><span class="smcap">Adele</span>
takes her hat out of the lowest drawer of the desk.</i>]
What are you doing?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—Getting my hat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—[<i>Excitedly.</i>] But, my dear, where do
you expect to talk to him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—Now don’t get excited.... And I told
you before you are not to call me dear in the shop.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—[<i>With a glance through the archway.</i>]
He can’t hear me. He’s up on the ladder. And
no matter if he does hear me to-day. You are not
going home with him, are you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—No; I’m only getting my hat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—You settle everything with him right here
... in the shop.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—All right! All right! [<i>Takes off her
hat.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—[<i>Excitedly.</i>] I won’t have you go home
with him any more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—Don’t get so excited. I’ll talk to him
right here. But I have to wait until the customers
are gone, haven’t I?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—Yes, certainly. [<i>Nervously resumes his
task of clearing the counter.</i>] Forgive me, dear,
but I’m awfully nervous. And no wonder.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—I’m nervous, too. But I control myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—I’ll be right near you, and if you need
me I’ll come over. The main thing is to keep cool.
Now, of all times, you must be cool.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—Leave everything to me. If I need you
I’ll call you in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—That’s right! That’s right! There’s
only one thing I want to impress upon you. No
scandal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—He’d never make a scandal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—And you have no business going to his
house after this. When you leave here to-day there
is only one place for you to go: your mother’s house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—Now, dear, you’re getting excited again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—How can you expect me to be calm? I
stand at the turning point of my life. And I’m subject
to heart attacks. It runs in our family. I
have to be very careful.... And yet, my God ...
[<i>stops his work</i>] when I think that to-night ...
this ordinary spring night ... this commonplace
Thursday evening ... you are to be mine ... definitely
and forever ... mine ... body and soul....
Come here!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—Be careful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—Come here, come here!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—[<i>Goes to him.</i>] There now, you are
getting all excited again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—Only your hand, your hand ... for a
moment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—But Oscar!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—Your hand! You know I’ve got heart
trouble! [<i>She gives him her hand. He takes it,
looks cautiously through the archway, then speaks,
softly but passionately.</i>] Mine! My own wife!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
Before all the world! And together we begin a new
and wonderful life. To-night I lead you forth from
your prison.... Don’t take your hand away! I
won’t have you take your hand away!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—[<i>Leaves him; returns to her desk.</i>] You
must behave yourself, Oscar, or you’ll make me
nervous, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—Your hand, your hand, your mouth....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Young Gentleman</span>—[<i>At the cashier’s desk.</i>] As

Three hundred and eighty-eight ... twelve ...

<p><span class="smcap">Young Gentleman</span>—[<i>Staring in surprise at

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—[<i>Hurries to open the door for him.</i>]
Good night, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Young Gentleman</span>—Good night. [<i>He exits,

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—Thank you, sir. Good night. [<i>A brief

go.... [<i>To <span class="smcap">Philip</span>.</i>] Philip, clear those rags
away, will you? [<i>He points to the materials on the

for Lohengrin to-night?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—[<i>As he goes up toward the archway.</i>]
For what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—For the opera.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—[<i>Already working at the counter.</i>]
That makes no difference.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—It doesn’t begin till seven-thirty. [<i>He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
exits through the archway. There is a brief pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—It begins at seven, but it doesn’t matter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—Leave that stuff, Philip, and run along
to your opera.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—Oh, it’s all the same to me now. I’ve
been to Lohengrin sixteen times and was late every
time. To-night I’ll be late for the seventeenth time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—Leave that, then, and go, why don’t you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—Oh, I might as well be an hour late now.
I know all of Lohengrin by heart. The only reason
I accept tickets for it any more is because I’ve never
succeeded in seeing the beginning. The part where
the swan comes on the stage, pulling Lohengrin in a
boat. I’d like to see that just once. But it’s too
late now. The swan’s all through by this time, and
has gone home for his supper. [<i>Continues to fold

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—My husband will clear that away. Don’t
be so obstinate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—You seem very eager to get rid of me
to-night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—I don’t know what makes you think that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—Just things I’ve noticed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—What have you noticed?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—Maybe I had better keep my mouth shut.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—That’s always a good idea. And yet, as
long as you mentioned it——</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—Please, please.... I don’t want to
know. Just leave me out of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—Out of what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—Out of what’s going on around here.
I’m just a lonesome old man——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—You are a hateful old man. [<i>Wrathfully.</i>]
You hate Oscar because he is the heart and
soul of the business, because he is young, and clever,
and has nice manners, and knows the business better
than you do, and because the customers like him
better. You are jealous of him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—I consider Mr. Oscar a very ordinary
young man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—And I admire his type very much!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—His kind must live, too, I suppose.

<p><span class="smcap">Aristocratic Lady</span>—No, your Biarritz won’t do.
I wonder you keep that grade of material at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Perhaps madame will be good enough to
come in again next week. We are expecting an entirely
new lot from Vienna. We are certain to find
something you like.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aristocratic Lady</span>—[<i>Goes to the cashier’s desk.</i>]
Your patience is endless, Mr. Juhasz.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aristocratic Lady</span>—You are an angel. A perfect<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
angel! [<i>To <span class="smcap">Adele</span>.</i>] I hope you don’t mind
my paying your husband compliments.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—Indeed, no.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aristocratic Lady</span>—I daresay you are used to
it. Everybody adores Mr. Juhasz.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—Oh, madame!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aristocratic Lady</span>—You are a very fortunate
young woman to have such a husband.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—It’s I who am fortunate, madame, to have
such a devoted little wife. The poor darling sits
here every day from early morning till late at night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aristocratic Lady</span>—Has the count been here
lately?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—Our benefactor?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aristocratic Lady</span>—The guardian angel of the
establishment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—He was here the day before yesterday.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aristocratic Lady</span>—How is he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—In love with my husband.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aristocratic Lady</span>—You mustn’t joke about
that, young lady. Everybody loves your husband
but his heart is for you alone. Good night, Mr.
Angel.... I shall look at that Biarritz again in
the daylight and that ... what do you call it
... too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—[<i>Angry, but sweetly.</i>] Agreable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aristocratic Lady</span>—Agreable. Well, good
night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span></p>

night. [<i>The <span class="smcap">Aristocratic Lady</span> exits.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Closing the door.</i>] Why didn’t you
say good night, Philip?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—[<i>Resentfully.</i>] Good night, madame.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Well, well. [<i>To <span class="smcap">Adele</span>.</i>] What a
handsome woman she is!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—She’s been handsome a long time now.
And she owes more than she’s worth. You are the
only merchant in town who gives her credit any more.
You just let her haul the stuff out of here as if it
didn’t cost you anything.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—What can she do, poor woman? She’s
got to keep up her social position.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—But not with your money.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Aristocratic poverty is the bitterest
kind. I haven’t the heart to refuse her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—Philip is in a temper because he has missed
the swan again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Looks at his watch.</i>] Did you have
a ticket for Lohengrin again?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—Yes, and I’ve still got it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Why didn’t you tell me? You know I’d
have let you off at six-thirty. That really makes
me angry. I told you long ago——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—Because you’re good-hearted there’s no
need for me to——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—There goes my heart again. You all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>

You leave my heart alone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Go on now. What are you waiting for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—Thanks, but I shan’t go at all to-night.
[<i>He exits through the archway. There is a pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—What’s wrong with him to-night?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—I don’t know, and I really don’t care.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Why, Adele!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—[<i>Comes out from behind the desk.</i>]
Don’t be angry, Peter. I am a bit upset to-night.
I’ve come to a very important decision ... and I
feel ... I must tell you about it to-day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—My dear child ... I didn’t think you
had a care in the world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—Yes, I have.... But you are so good
... so much better than anyone else.... I hardly
know how to begin. It’s terribly hard to tell
you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Hard? To tell me? There, put on your
things ... and you can tell me all about it on the
way home. Or while we are at supper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—No, Peter, I can’t tell you on the way
home ... or at supper either. This is something
I must tell you here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Here and nowhere else?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—Here ... and now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Urgent as all that! [<i>Calls through the

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—You will understand ... when I’ve told
you ... that [<i><span class="smcap">Paula</span> enters through the archway,

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—May I interrupt a moment, Mrs. Juhasz?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—Certainly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—Semlinger and Weiss have written about
those motor robes again ... the leather-bound
ones. They say they are holding two dozen for us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—[<i>Uneasily.</i>] Let me see. [<i>She takes the
letter.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Didn’t you answer them last week?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—Mrs. Juhasz thought we might wait
awhile.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—How dare you say such a thing?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—But, my dear....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—[<i>Coldly.</i>] Mrs. Juhasz instructed me
not to answer it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—If Miss Paula says you....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—I suppose she <i>can’t</i> be mistaken.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—I usually am not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—What do I care about your old motor
robes? [<i>Throws the letter away.</i>] I have nothing
to do with it. [<i>Walks away from them.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Picks up the letter.</i>] My wife’s a bit
nervous to-night. Write Semlinger and Weiss, Miss
Paula, that we’ll take the whole two dozen. [<i>Gives<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
her the letter; looks at his watch.</i>] But do it in the
morning. Go home now. To-morrow is another day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—Thanks, Mr. Juhasz, but I don’t like to
go home while there is work unfinished.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Miss Paula, I’ve warned you before ...
you’ll ruin your eyes if you are not careful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—No fear, Mr. Juhasz.... There was
something about waterproof coats, too, in their first
letter. I must look it up. [<i>She exits through the
archway.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—How thorough she is, how orderly!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—That’s what she’s paid for. You only
see the good side of people.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—I think that must be the only side they
show me. [<i><span class="smcap">Adolf</span> enters through the archway,

Close up, Adolf; close up. It’s half past seven.

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—Not as good as it might be.... Your
excellency has been so generous to us.... I feel I
ought to tell you frankly ... it’s quite bad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—There is no accounting for it. For two
years business was splendid, and now, in the third
year, it suddenly stopped. It just won’t go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—But my whole family deals here ... and
all my friends ... and all my acquaintances.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—Oh, yes, your excellency. We have you

up in business, but for getting us most of our customers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—I trust that Juhasz isn’t going into debt.
[<i>She nods in the affirmative.</i>] I daresay he gives his
neckties away for nothing. That’s why you are
losing money.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—He’d give the whole shop away, if it were

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—He had the same weakness when he worked

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—It’s largely his fault.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—And what about that young man you

industrious girl, what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—Your excellency’s favorite.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—[<i>Impatiently.</i>] Show it to Mr. Oscar.</p>

coats.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—Why not? They are very useful things.
They keep the rain out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—If your excellency would like to order
one——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—Oh, indeed, no! I can’t bear waterproof
coats. [<i>Looks at Paula.</i>] Miss Paula is smiling....

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—Well, not exactly old.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—I smiled because your excellency has such
an aversion for waterproof coats. But I never
thought of you as old.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—Not at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—She is deceitful. I can’t bear her. Ordinarily
she is very glum and serious, but when your
excellency puts your foot in the door she suddenly
becomes brisk and cheerful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—That was clever of you. Thanks very
much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—Not at all, your excellency. [<i>She exits
through the archway.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—[<i>His glance has followed her until she
vanished.</i>] Well, then ... there was something I
wanted to say.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Where you want the cap sent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—Yes. Hm! Nowhere. I’m going to the
casino ... my motor will pick me up there....
You keep the cap for me here. I’ll stop for it later.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—[<i>Briskly.</i>] Just as you say, sir. I’ll have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
it packed up for you at once. Excuse me, excellency.
[<i>Hurries off through the archway.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—[<i>Stares after him in amazement; does not
speak until he is gone.</i>] What an extraordinary
fellow!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>With an apologetic smile.</i>] He is always
in a hurry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—[<i>Comes affectionately close to <span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>.</i>]
Business bad, eh? [<i><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span> looks quickly at <span class="smcap">Adele</span>.</i>]
Yes, she told me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—I didn’t think we had any secrets from
his——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—From his excellency? No. But I don’t
like to have you complain——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—She didn’t complain. She only answered
my questions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Well, there are a few difficulties, but
... we’ll overcome them somehow. We shan’t go
into bankruptcy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—I should hope not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—We’ve worked faithfully ... but one
can’t expect the sun to shine all the time. There
must be cloudy days, too. But they pass.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—[<i>Affectionately.</i>] I should be offended if
my friend Juhasz were in trouble and didn’t tell me.
Well? You must tell me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—No real trouble, your excellency. I have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
my health and a good little wife [<i>takes her hand</i>]
who loves me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—[<i>To <span class="smcap">Adele</span>, approvingly.</i>] That’s right.
Bravo!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—And friends ... my smart and loyal
Oscar. He is the heart and soul of the business.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—He seems a bit ... sudden.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—And then there is Paula. She is the
policeman of the business. Now, how can I possibly
go wrong?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—Well, my dear Juhasz, I must be off. [<i>As
he shakes hands.</i>] I can only tell you again what I
told you once before, when you were in difficulties....
For fifteen years you sat at a desk in my castle
at Gerelypuszta. I never had as good a man in my
service before or since. It is true you wasted a lot
of your time cultivating flowers, and at best you were
never very energetic....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—That is something one learns.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—Never, but that doesn’t matter. It is
character that counts with me. That desk has been
vacant three years now. I want you to know that,
whatever happens, that place is open to you as long
as Gerelypuszta belongs to me or my family.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Oh, your excellency!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—If I only had someone half as honest as
you right now! We are beginning to export cheese
on a large scale. Mostly to England.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Puszta cheese?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—Yes ... it has been a great success.
London is mad about that cheese. And so am I. I
took first prize with it in London and in Edinburgh,
too. You have no idea how proud that made me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—I remember your first experiment with
that cheese.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—But you’d never know it now. [<i>With
enthusiasm.</i>] I succeeded in crossing two breeds:
Camembert, that over-ripe beauty, with Roquefort,
that sharp, sardonic old gentleman. And the child
of that marriage I nurtured and reared with my own
hands. So naturally I am proud of the career it is
making for itself.... Well, I must be going. Remember,
let nothing worry you. If everything else
fails you: Gerelypuszta, Desk, Cheese! Good night!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—Good night, your excellency.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Opens the door.</i>] See you later, excellency.
[<i>The <span class="smcap">Count</span> exits. He closes the door.</i>]
You shouldn’t have complained to him, dear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—I didn’t. He asked me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—I don’t want to be put in a false position.
He has done more for me already than my own father
could have done.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—[<i>Hesitantly.</i>] Well, now, Peter ... if
you have a moment....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Certainly, my angel. I’m really curious
to know what it is that’s agitating this [<i>takes her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
head in his hands</i>] precious little head. [<i>Looks into
her eyes.</i>] See here! There are tears in your eyes!
It isn’t anything serious?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—Yes, Peter, it is serious ... very serious.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—[<i>Pulls a stool over for him.</i>] Sit down
here, Peter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Serious as that? [<i>He sits.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—There are two separate things I must talk
to you about. And one is harder than the other.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Let us have the hardest first.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—If you weren’t such a good man, it
wouldn’t be half as difficult to tell you—— [<i>She
dries her eyes.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—There, there, my dear! I am sure you
have done nothing you need to cry about.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—It’s on your account I’m crying.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—On my account?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—Peter ... [<i>Dries her eyes; collects
herself.</i>] Those different sums of money ... you
gave me ... I made you give me ... these past
three years ... because you are so foolish about
money ... and can’t refuse anyone who asks you....
I told you I was putting the money in a savings
bank.... Well, so I did.... You know it
amounts to fifty-one thousand kronen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—I know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—I just found out from Oscar that there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
had been a meeting of your creditors, and that the
lawyer came to see you.... You didn’t tell me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—No, dear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—You didn’t tell me because you were
afraid I’d be worried. I know.... You offered the
creditors this fifty-one thousand kronen on account
of their claims if they would refrain from forcing
you into bankruptcy ... and they accepted because
they like you and trust you [<i>bursts into tears</i>]
and know you are the best and most honest man in
the world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—I asked Oscar not to say anything to you
about it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—He was right to tell me. And now, Peter,
it is terrible to have to say it straight to your
face....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—You spent some of the money. No matter,
my child. Don’t let it worry you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—Oh, my God ... my God....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—All the money isn’t worth this agitation.
Tell me how much is gone. I’ll raise it somehow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—A great deal is gone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—How much? Whatever you spent, I’m
sure you did it for the best.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—Peter ... forgive me ... it is all
gone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—All?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—All. There isn’t a heller left.... Peter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
... [<i>Weeping.</i>] Kill me. I have ruined you. [<i>A
brief pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—My dear ... really ... it doesn’t
matter.... I thought God knows what had happened
... but if that’s all....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—Don’t try to make light of it, Peter. I
know perfectly well that what the lawyer told you
was the creditors’ very last offer. But when I found
that out, it was too late. The money was gone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Now you mustn’t cry. It’s childish to
take the thing so much to heart. Everything will be
all right. The lawyer’s heart isn’t made of stone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—[<i>Weeping.</i>] All lawyers’ hearts are
made of stone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—We’ll have a nice little talk with him.
My money is your money, isn’t it? It’s all my fault,
anyway. Why didn’t I save the money myself?...
You had a perfect right to spend it. Kiss me,
and tell what else is troubling you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—[<i>Kisses him.</i>] You are so good!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Well now, out with the other calamity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—That is much harder.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—No matter, my dear. It won’t be as bad
as you suppose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—You know that I have always been a
faithful wife to you.... We have no children ...
and ours wasn’t exactly a love marriage ... but all
my affections were yours. [<i><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span> takes her hand.</i>]<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
In the whole three years I never looked at or thought
of another man ... and that is precisely why it’s
so hard for me now.... If I weren’t a respectable
woman, it would be easy ... but I simply can’t deceive
a man like you.... I can’t.... [<i>A brief
pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—You love ... someone else. [<i>She only
nods. He utters the word for her softly, thoughtfully.</i>]
Yes. [<i>There is a pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—I respect you too much to let you go on
believing for a single moment.... [<i>Another pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—You don’t love me any more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—I do care for you, but....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—But you love someone else.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—I love <i>you</i> like a brother ... you know
yourself I never loved your body ... only your
soul.... It was always a struggle for me ... but
now that I love another ... I must tell you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—This comes ... so suddenly.... I—I—— [<i><span class="smcap">Adele</span>
sobs.</i>] You poor, dear child....
It’s only a sort of illness.... It will pass....
Every wife goes through such a crisis ... some time
or another.... And I’ll help you through it....
I’ll be as gentle and tactful as I can.... And before
you know it, you’ll have forgotten all about it
... and come to your senses ... and be the same
happy, contented Adele you used to be.... My
good, loyal Adele, I don’t know how another man<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
would act in my place ... but this is how I feel....
But there! Are you crying again?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—It’s unbearable how good you are!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Shouldn’t I have said that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—Peter ... this isn’t just a passing
fancy, as you suppose. I not only love this man....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—What else?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—I want to belong to him. [<i>A pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—That is ... more serious. [<i>Takes an
aimless pace or two, sits down, puts his head in his
hands.</i>] When you said that ... I felt so ...
lonely ... all of a sudden.</p>

<p>[<i>A delivery boy enters at the door. He carries
three big packages and a rocking-horse.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Delivery Boy</span>—Mr. Peter Juhasz?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Goes to him.</i>] Yes, yes. From the toy
store?... All right, my son, just put them down.
[<i>Gives the boy a tip; calls.</i>] Adolf!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Delivery Boy</span>—Thank you, sir. Good night.
[<i>The boy exits at the door. <span class="smcap">Adolf</span> enters through
the archway.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—For your little boy’s birthday to-morrow.
A horse, a steamship and an automobile. And
this is for your little girl, so that she won’t feel
slighted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf</span>—[<i>Tries to kiss his hand.</i>] Oh, thank you
... thank you, sir!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Yes, yes. Take them away.... Or,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
wait! Leave the steamship here a moment. I’ll have
to show you how it works.... The automobile is
quite simple, but the ship has a rather complicated
mechanism.... I’ll explain it to you before I go
home. [<i><span class="smcap">Adolf</span> puts the steamship under the down-stage
end of the counter at right, then exits through
the archway with the remaining packages. <span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>
turns to <span class="smcap">Adele</span>.</i>] Forgive me.... My god-son,
you know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—[<i>Who has been weeping silently.</i>] Peter,
if you only knew how sorry I am.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—I’m afraid I made it harder for you ...
but I have a headache ... and everything came at
once.... I’m sorry ... but you <i>were</i> a bit cruel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—Kill me, Peter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—But you were honest with me ... you
couldn’t be anything else. And yet I think it would
have been less painful to me ... if you had simply
betrayed me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—I can’t betray you, Peter. I respect you
too much. [<i>Weeping.</i>] Don’t ask me to do that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—You want to become another man’s wife.
How can I prevent you? Go, if you must. He is
surely a better man than——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—No, no!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—But you are leaving me for him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—You are a much better man ... and yet
... I can’t explain——</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Younger, better looking....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—Do you know who it is?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—I don’t want to know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—I don’t want to hurt you again ... but
you must soon find out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Soon find out? [<i>A brief pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—Oscar.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Oscar ... our Oscar?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—Yes. [<i>A pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—So that ... so that....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—[<i>Ardently.</i>] I love him, Peter, and he
adores me. And we are leaving the city.... You
will never hear of us again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Oscar....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—All the time we’ve been here together,
like one big family, we could have done things behind
your back. But a man like you.... We couldn’t
bring ourselves to deceive you. Oscar couldn’t
either. He loves you like a brother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—I know ... you are both devoted to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—We are going to Berlin. There a new
life awaits us ... but that’s something you can’t
understand, because there is no spirit of adventure
in you.... To escape from this cage ... out into
the wide world ... to try our luck ... and find
wealth, perhaps ... and power.... Let me call
him in!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—If you like.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—He is so fond of you. [<i>Runs to the archway.</i>]
Oscar! [<i>Comes down stage again.</i>] It
grieves him so.... [<i><span class="smcap">Oscar</span> enters through the
archway, slowly, sadly. Up stage, between the two
counters, he pauses.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—Does he know everything?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—Peter, this moment had to come.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Never mind that, my son.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—[<i>Begins rhetorically.</i>] From first to last
our conduct has been irreproachable——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—It’s my own conduct I’m thinking about,
not yours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—I see you intend to act nobly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Nobly?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—Or else you would kill both of us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Please! I don’t want to stand in your
way. I don’t know how another man would act in
my place, but——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Adele</span>—[<i>Simultaneously.</i>] The same!
Just the same!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—But it’s the way I feel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—You are the best ... the best ... the
best.... [<i>Suddenly kisses his hand.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Have you gone mad?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—Pardon me. Before we part forever there
is one promise I want to make you on my sacred<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
word of honor. I’ll send you back that money the
very first day I get it. Not a day later.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—[<i>Quickly; embarrassed.</i>] I couldn’t tell
you before.... I had hoped you’d understand. I
didn’t spend the fifty-one thousand kronen myself....
I gave them to Oscar.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—[<i>Quickly.</i>] That is, not for me, but for a
little enterprise in Berlin in which I have bought an
interest. A little shop of which I—that is, we—are
to be one-fourth owners. Steger and Company!
Steger—that’s Steger. And the Company—that’s
me.... At first I thought of putting up my own
name instead of Company, but as long as Adele got
the money I decided it would be only fair to say
Company, and that includes her too....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—She gave the money to you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—I didn’t want it for myself. My God, I
can live on bread and water. But I couldn’t ask
Adele to share the uncertain existence of a shop
clerk.... That would have been, if I may say so,
unscrupulous of me. I had to provide for her future.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—If she gave you the money, it’s yours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—I considered that I owed it to <i>you</i> to provide
for her future decently. You would have every
right to despise me if I hadn’t.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—I must admit ... you managed things
cleverly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—[<i>In an injured tone.</i>] What do you mean<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
by that? I did everything honestly and above board.
[<i>Takes <span class="smcap">Adele’s</span> hand.</i>] Our relations couldn’t have
been purer if we were two children.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>A bit sharply.</i>] Please! I forbid you
to discuss that. She is still my wife. There is no
question about her purity here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—[<i>Aggressively.</i>] I might have known you
would take that tone. [<i><span class="smcap">Philip</span> appears in the archway.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—You are wanted on the telephone, Mr.
Juhasz.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Coming. [<i>He exits through the archway;
<span class="smcap">Philip</span> lets him pass, looks frigidly at <span class="smcap">Adele</span>
and <span class="smcap">Oscar</span>, then exits too.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—[<i>Suddenly.</i>] What did you shout at him
for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—I know what I’m doing. Just you cry
... and let me shout. Now hurry and get ready.
He’s taken it much too hard to suit me. Where’s
your hat?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—But I’ve got to say good-bye to——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—Get your hat when I tell you to! I know
what I’m talking about. Have some consideration
for my weak heart, and don’t get me excited.
[<i><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span> re-enters.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Sees the hat in <span class="smcap">Adele’s</span> hand.</i>] It was
your sister. She wanted to know whether we could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
come to supper to-night. I told her ... that ...
I didn’t know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—Adele is going to her mother’s.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Right now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—Right now. [<i>There is a pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Then ... it’s to-night ... you’re
leaving?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—We have decided ... as long as everything
is settled ... that Adele hadn’t better go to
your house any more. That would only make it
harder for you ... and we would like to ...
spare you ... all we can.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—It’s your feelings we are considering....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—You are right. That would be best.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—I’m going to mother’s, and Oscar goes to
Berlin to-morrow. And we shan’t see each other
again until after the divorce is granted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—We mean to do what’s correct ...
everything correct. We owe that much to you.
And, on my word of honor, you’ll get your money
back as soon as I have it. I shan’t wait for profits.
No; I’ll send it to you out of the first money we
take in. Without a moment’s delay. Here’s my
hand on it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Waving away the proffered hand.</i>]
That’s all right. I don’t think you’d lie to me now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—You know me better than that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>To <span class="smcap">Adele</span>, who has put on her things.</i>]<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
Then ... we shan’t see each other ... for a long
... for a long time.... Perhaps never.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—[<i>Uneasily.</i>] Don’t say that. It’s not fair
to say that. If ever you are in Berlin, consider our
home your own.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Thank you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—And let’s not prolong our leavetakings.
I’ve got to consider my weak heart. Excitement is
bad for me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—Good-bye, Peter. Will you kiss me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—Kiss her. She’s worthy of it. [<i>Turns
away and dries his eyes.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Kisses her.</i>] Don’t cry, Adele....
I suppose it had to be ... but not one woman in
a thousand would have acted as you have acted....
There! Lift up your head and smile at
me.... You were a good wife to me ... and now
you are my very good friend. [<i><span class="smcap">Adele</span> nods.</i>] Shall
I see you as far as your mother’s house?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adele</span>—No.... I’ll take a cab. Good-bye,
Peter. [<i>She nods silently to <span class="smcap">Oscar</span> and passes
swiftly through the door. There is a brief pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—Only one word more, Peter, about a matter
of business, and then we can shake hands and
part. I had a talk with the lawyer to-day——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—But, please——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—I couldn’t go away and let them throw
you into bankruptcy. [<i>Hands him a document.</i>]<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
Here is the agreement. Read it over when you get
home. It stipulates that, in consideration of your
unquestionable integrity, your creditors agree not
to file a petition in bankruptcy against you, but to
wait six months longer ... for the fifty-one thousand
kronen you lent me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Lent you? Yes, that’s right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—And which I will return to you ... my
word of honor ... maybe in two weeks, maybe not
for three months, but certainly within six months.
My word of honor!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Turning the document over helplessly.</i>]
Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—But your creditors make one stipulation.
Until the fifty-one thousand is paid to them, they
want a receiver to run the business instead of you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Receiver?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—It’s wrong, I know ... but in some ways
the creditors are right.... You are too easy with
people who owe you money ... and with the people
who work for you.... You are not businesslike....
What this place needs is a strong hand....
They tried to get me to take charge, but I.... Of
course they didn’t know anything about.... I only
said I was leaving the country.... Well, the main
thing is that on the day you pay the fifty-one thousand
kronen the business is yours again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—And this ... receiver?... When does
he take charge?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—On the day I leave.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—You said you were leaving to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Well, then——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—To-morrow morning at eight the receiver
will be here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Then the shop doesn’t belong to me any
more ... and I may as well stay home to-morrow
morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—What’s the use of exaggerating like that?
Certainly you can come to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—As a clerk in my own shop?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—Can I help it? Didn’t I do everything I
could? Didn’t I run around seeing people and
making arrangements? [<i>More and more resentfully.</i>]
I didn’t expect any thanks for it, but you
needn’t look at me that way. As for the money, my
word of honor——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—I know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—[<i>Takes his hand.</i>] Good luck! [<i>Points
to the archway.</i>] I’m going that way. I shan’t
even walk the same street as Adele until the divorce
is granted. [<i>In the archway.</i>] Don’t look at me
like that! [<i>Emotionally.</i>] I had to provide for her
future, hadn’t I? [<i>He exits. <span class="smcap">Juhasz</span> is left alone.
He looks at the document, crumples it into his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
pocket, glances around the shop, then sits down near
the counter, at right, staring vacantly. <span class="smcap">Paula</span>
enters through the archway, a letter in her hand.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—You still here, Paula?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—About those waterproof coats, Mr.
Juhasz. Mr. Oscar referred me to your wife [<i>notices
that <span class="smcap">Adele</span> is not there; pauses</i>]—and she said
we didn’t want any waterproof coats, but I think
we really should order a few. [<i>Waits for his answer.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Lost in thought, still staring absently.</i>]
Yes. [<i>A pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—Shall I order some, Mr. Juhasz?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Looks up at her.</i>] What? Oh, yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—About a dozen? [<i>A pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Paula—— [<i>He rises.</i>] The fact is
that from to-morrow on the shop doesn’t belong
to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—Doesn’t belong to you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—In a word, Paula, my wife has left me
and is going to Berlin with Oscar ... and I have
failed.... To-morrow morning a receiver, appointed
by my creditors, takes charge ... and he’ll
be the boss here.... So why should I worry my
head about waterproof coats? [<i>A pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—I—I don’t know what to say, Mr. Juhasz.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Don’t say anything, Paula. I didn’t say<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
anything myself. No. And let those letters go for
to-night. I can’t have you ruining your eyes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—As if you hadn’t troubles enough of your
own without worrying about my eyes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Troubles?... Well....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—I can imagine how you must feel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Yes, here I stand like a tree in the park
that is only good for lovers to meet under....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—And then go away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—But first they cut their names in it with
a sharp knife. [<i><span class="smcap">Adolf</span>, carrying his long pole,
comes through the archway.</i>] What’s the matter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf</span>—It’s eight o’clock, Mr. Juhasz.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Still a bit absently.</i>] Yes, you can
really close up now, Adolf. [<i><span class="smcap">Adolf</span> goes out, pulls
the grating half way down.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—[<i>His voice is heard from the street.</i>]
Here, here, here! Are you trying to lock me out
again? [<i>He dodges under the grating and enters.
He is wearing a motor coat and cap. <span class="smcap">Adolf</span>, pole
in hand, follows him in, grinning.</i>] Tell me, my
friend, do you do that on purpose? [<i><span class="smcap">Adolf</span> only
grins.</i>] Whenever I try to get in you come along
with that big stick and pull the grating down. You
don’t like me, what? [<i><span class="smcap">Adolf’s</span> grin is broader.</i>]
Here! [<i>Gives him money.</i>] Here is something for
you. Try to like me better. [<i><span class="smcap">Adolf</span> tries to kiss
his hand. The <span class="smcap">Count</span> waves him off.</i>] Never mind<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
that. [<i>The <span class="smcap">Count</span> comes down right. <span class="smcap">Adolf</span> exits
through the archway.</i>] He is always trying to
close the door in my face. [<i>Looks at them wonderingly.</i>]
What’s the matter? You look so cheerful,
Juhasz.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Excellency.... I don’t know how to
tell you. [<i><span class="smcap">Paula</span> is about to go.</i>] Don’t go, Miss
Paula.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—I only wanted to see whether the cap
has arrived for his excellency.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—Thank you, Paula.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—Not at all, your excellency. [<i>She exits
through the archway.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—Well, what is it? Things going wrong
after all?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Not exactly wrong, excellency. I suppose
everything that happens is for the best. But
just a while ago your excellency was kind enough
to repeat what you had often said before....
[<i>Pushes a stool toward him.</i>] Please sit down.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—[<i>Sits.</i>] Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—That desk at Gerelypuszta ... which
... was always open to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—Yes, yes. What of it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Well, I’d like to go back to that desk.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—How’s that? In the last ten minutes
you’ve....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—In the last ten minutes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—That is very interesting. [<i>Looks
around.</i>] Where is your wife?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—That’s just it, your excellency.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—I don’t understand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—My wife is going to divorce me and
marry Oscar. The business is to be taken over by
a receiver to-morrow morning. And here I stand,
all alone in the world and free as a bird.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—[<i>Jovially.</i>] My dear Juhasz, you are
not a bird, you are now general manager ... or
no ... general director of the Gerelypuszta Cheese
Exporting Company.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Your excellency’s generosity is boundless.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—The excellence of Gerelypuszta cheese is
boundless, and my luck is boundless to get you back
again. Juhasz, I wouldn’t trust my own brother
with that cheese ... but I’ll trust you with it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—I shall be very happy if....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—I shall be happy. When can you come?
Drive down with me to-night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Excellency, my things, my house....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—How soon <i>can</i> you come?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Well ... perhaps the end of this week
... or the beginning of next.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—The sooner the better. You can’t come
soon enough to suit me. [<i>Rises.</i>] I congratulate
myself. [<i><span class="smcap">Paula</span> enters through the archway.</i>]<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
Now we will organize things on a big scale, Juhasz.
We shall become an international enterprise. Gerelypuszta
Cheeses, Ltd.!... And as to my neighbor
and competitor, Baron Goldberger, we’ll settle
him!... But, my dear friend, how selfish of me!
I forgot all about your troubles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—And I forgot all about your caps, excellency.
[<i>Starts to go.</i>] Excuse me a moment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—The caps just came. Philip is wrapping
them up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—One is to go in with that jockey suit.
[<i>He exits through the archway. There is a pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—Well, Miss Paula, what do you think
of it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—It’s a gorgeous red, your excellency.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—What is?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—The cap.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—You little rogue! You know very well
I mean this ... er ... domestic tragedy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—What <i>can</i> I think of it, your excellency?
[<i>Comes nearer to him.</i>] I know what it means to
<i>me</i>. I’ve lost my job.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—How’s that? Can’t you stay on with
the new boss?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—I suppose I could, but mother wouldn’t
dream of letting me.... She only let me work for
Mr. Juhasz because he has been a sort of second
father to me. But I know she won’t let me stay<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
under any other boss.... And I haven’t the heart
to oppose mother’s wishes. The poor dear is so ill,
and she has trouble enough with my wild brother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—[<i>Who has been studying her appraisingly.</i>]
Too bad! I shall be sorry not to see you
any more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—Oh, your excellency!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—But even if you were staying on, I
shouldn’t come here any more.... I only came on
Juhasz’s account.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—We all know that, your excellency.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—Yes. And yet I am really sorry I shan’t
be seeing you any more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—Oh, your excellency!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—It was always a great pleasure to see
you ... when I happened to come in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—Your excellency embarrasses me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—May I make a parting confession?
Often I came only for the privilege of seeing you and
exchanging a few casual words with you. To-day,
for instance. Though you did make fun of me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—I didn’t, your excellency.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—Because I am an old boy.... But all
is not old that glitters. Why, my heart feels seventeen
when I see you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—But, your excellency!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—Oh, let’s drop that “excellency”!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
[<i><span class="smcap">Philip</span> enters through the archway, drying his
hands.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—[<i>Unaware of <span class="smcap">Philip’s</span> presence.</i>] You
mustn’t think I consider you old.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—Now ... don’t pretend!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—Your white hair ... is one of your
most attractive features.... If you only knew ...
how odious young men are ... compared with an
aristocratic, middle-aged gentleman like.... Oh,
your excellency, I beg pardon.... I’ll go and get
your package. [<i>Makes a movement toward the
archway.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—Wait! Juhasz will bring it. Don’t rob
me of this last minute with you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—[<i>With fine coquetry.</i>] Last?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—You are going home to your mother, and
I am going back to Gerelypuszta.... You are a
very clever girl ... and I am not exactly stupid
myself.... It would not be impossible, I daresay,
to find you somewhere in the city.... But an old
man must be as cautious and circumspect ... as
a young girl ... and I try to be a very sensible
old man.... I shall teach myself to do without
you ... slowly, painlessly. [<i><span class="smcap">Philip</span> goes up behind
the counter at back.</i>] Poor Juhasz went into
bankruptcy just in time for me, just in time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—All packed and ready, your excellency.
[<i>Goes to the door.</i>] I’ll give it to your chauffeur.
[<i>He exits.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—What is that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—One jockey suit and a cap, your excellency.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—[<i>Turns in surprise.</i>] Oh, you are here
too?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—I am here, excellency.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—[<i>Turns to <span class="smcap">Paula</span>.</i>] Well, then ... good-bye,
Miss Paula.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—[<i>With a bow.</i>] Your excellency!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—You don’t even offer to shake hands?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—Oh!... [<i>They shake hands.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—[<i>To <span class="smcap">Philip</span>, going.</i>] Good night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—Good night, your excellency.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—[<i>In the doorway.</i>] Tell that man with
the long stick that he can pull this grating down
now. [<i>Dodges under the grating and exits.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>His voice is heard from the street.</i>]
Good-bye, your excellency. [<i>The noise of a motor
starting is heard. It dwindles and dies out in the
distance.</i>] [<i><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span> re-enters.</i>] Well, children.
Let’s get finished. It is high time we were out of
here. [<i>He takes out a drawer of the cash-register
and exits with it through the archway.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—I want to bid you good-bye, Philip. I
suppose you will be staying on here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—Yes. You are a very sly young lady,
Paula.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—Am I? Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—I heard you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—Did you hear anything ... wrong?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—Wrong?... No.... Just clever.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—What do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—You know what you’re doing, my girl.
Only you started a bit late. Mr. Juhasz is going,
and the shop is gone, and the Count isn’t coming
back, and you won’t be able to flirt with him any
more. Too late!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—Do you think so?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—Yes, I do. The Count told you as much
to your face.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—I wouldn’t be so sure of that, Mr. Philip.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—Of what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—That I shan’t see the Count again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—Now you’re losing your temper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—[<i>With growing passion.</i>] A great deal
has gone on in this shop that you didn’t know about.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—Oh, I think not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—You’ve worked alongside of me for the
past three years and don’t know me yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—I think I do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—Then you won’t be surprised to hear that
I’m going to Gerelypuszta too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—What? What for?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—To be near the Count.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—In Heaven’s name! [<i>Clasps his hands
in horror.</i>] When did you decide that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—Just now.... This very minute. [<i>She
is greatly excited.</i>] Are you surprised?... For
a whole year that Mrs. Juhasz has plagued me....
You saw her.... She treated me like a dog....
Tried her best to drive me away. And why do you
suppose I was so patient? Why did I never answer
back?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—Miss Paula!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—[<i>Still more vehemently.</i>] What did I
endure it for? [<i>Points to the door.</i>] For my
future, Mr. Philip, for my future ... who just
passed through that door ... and rode off in his
motor car. But I mean to follow him, Mr. Philip.
Make no mistake about that. That old man has
been staring at me for a year ... ogling me ...
and I have been ... slowly and carefully ...
playing my game.... You needn’t look so horrified,
Mr. Philip ... a filthy little intrigue isn’t
what I was after ... no ... here I have sat ...
sighing away my youth ... among a lot of motor
coats bound for Paris and Ostend ... pretty travelling
veils soon to be worn in London ... and
Monte Carlo ... out in the great, glittering world....
I want to live, too, Mr. Philip, to live, to
live.... And now shall I give up all hope simply<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
because this little shop has gone under? No, my
dear Philip, I shan’t let his excellency get away
from me that easily.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—You won’t let him——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—I’m going to follow him to Gerelypuszta.
The rest will be easy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—And what will you tell your mother?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—That Mr. Juhasz is taking me. She’ll
let me go with him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—And what will you tell Mr. Juhasz?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—That I can’t leave him alone in all this
trouble ... that I can’t part from him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—Deceive him? You too? You’d take
advantage of him too?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—You’d use <i>him</i> for a purpose like that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—I’m sick of poverty, Mr. Philip.... If
you knew how sick I am of being poor!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—It’s monstrous!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—Can I help it?... I tell you I won’t
grow old over a typewriting machine. I won’t let
myself decay in this dingy office.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—But Mr. Juhasz——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—I’m not considering anyone except myself.
I need Mr. Juhasz now, and, no matter what you
say, I mean to use him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—[<i>Scrutinizing her narrowly.</i>] This isn’t
wickedness. It’s only childish egotism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—I mean to do just what I said.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—And suppose I prevent you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—How?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—Suppose I tell Mr. Juhasz exactly what
you said.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—First you worm everything out of me ...
and then.... But he wouldn’t believe you....
Besides ... you won’t tell ... you are too fond
of him yourself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—That’s exactly why. He is bound to
find out sooner or later.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—No. A man like him never sees such
things. [<i>Confidently.</i>] You won’t tell. You won’t
open your mouth. [<i><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span> enters through the archway,
carrying his hat and cane.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—And now, dear Miss Paula, there is one
painful duty left for me to do. I promised your
mother that I would look after you as a father ...
and now ... I must send you back to your mother....
I ... forgive me for the ceremony ... I
discharge you, Miss Paula.... But to-morrow I
will use what influence I may have with the new
boss——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—[<i>Firmly.</i>] That won’t be necessary, Mr.
Juhasz.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Don’t you want to keep your job?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Why not?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—Because I ... am going with you, Mr.
Juhasz.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—With me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—With you ... wherever you may go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Amazed.</i>] Miss Paula!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—There is no use discussing it. You know
I always do what I say.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Puts down his hat and stick.</i>] With
me, Miss Paula?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—With you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—But the place I am going to ... is a
tiny village ... deep in the country ... at the
end of the world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—I’m going too. If there’s work for you,
there will be work for me too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—But you are young, Miss Paula....
Why should you leave Budapest ... now ... when
so many new enterprises are being founded?...
Why, with your talent and industry——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—Let us not discuss it, please, Mr. Juhasz.
I am going with you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Do you hear that, Philip?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—[<i>Morosely.</i>] I hear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—Promise that you’ll take me with you
... and look upon me ... as you always have
... as your child ... as your friend.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Deeply moved.</i>] I am compensated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
... Paula ... for all ... all that I suffered to-day....
God is good to me, after all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—[<i>Low, ashamed.</i>] I am devoted to you,
Mr. Juhasz. You know that.... Will you excuse
me now? I must go, or mother will be worried
about me. [<i>Starts to go.</i>] Besides, I think Mr.
Philip has something to tell you. [<i>She exits
through the archway.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Deeply touched.</i>] What a heart she
has!... That is the stuff that saints and martyrs
are made of.... And to think that here [<i>with
an emotional break in his voice</i>]—here in this
dim little shop ... such loyalty ... such devotion
should have blossomed ... unknown....
[<i>Dries his eyes.</i>] It’s good to know there are such
people in the world! [<i><span class="smcap">Philip</span>, in surly silence, picks
up his hat and stick, pulls on his gloves.</i>] Is there
something you wanted to say to me, Philip?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—Hm.... Do you know that....
[<i>Stops.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—Well, you know ... er....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Don’t play the cynic with me, you old
hypocrite ... you.... I know what you are hiding
under those gruff, silent ways of yours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—No ... that’s not it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Now don’t pretend to me.... I know<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
your faithful heart, Philip ... you needn’t be
ashamed because you are touched.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—[<i>Lowers his eyes.</i>] You are right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—I knew it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—[<i>Softly.</i>] I am touched.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—What were you going to say to me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—I wasn’t going to say anything. [<i>There
is a pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Picks up his hat and stick.</i>] I’m a
lucky man, after all.... My wife and Oscar....
You must admit they were honest about it.... And
how eager he was to get me back the shop....
And the Count ... see how generous he was to
me.... And then ... to crown it all ... that
good, loyal girl.... Really, Philip, love and trust
are always repaid in kind in this world.... I’ve
found that out.... But you needn’t look so morose
about it....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—God bless you, Mr. Juhasz!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Look after things until I come back....
They are sure to send the money by autumn.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—Are they?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Oscar? He’ll send it ... if he has
to starve for it. [<i><span class="smcap">Paula</span> enters, dressed for the
street. Behind her comes <span class="smcap">Adolf</span> with his pole.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—Good night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Are you going to the opera?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—No. I gave my ticket to the cap-maker’s
apprentice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Then you’ll see Paula home as usual?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—Sorry. I’m going the other way to-night.
Good night!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Paula</span>—Good night. [<i><span class="smcap">Philip</span> exits
through the door. A brief pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—What’s the matter with Philip to-night?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—He’s upset, of course. He loves you
too.... [<i>A brief pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf</span>—Can I close up now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Certainly. [<i><span class="smcap">Adolf</span> exits. A brief
pause.</i>] What are you waiting for? Why don’t
you pull it down?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf</span>—[<i>Sticks his head in the doorway.</i>] I was
just looking to see if his excellency was coming.
[<i>He vanishes. The sound of the grating descending
is heard.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Now then ... I’ll see you home myself,
Paula.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—Don’t bother, Mr. Juhasz. I live quite
near, you know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—No matter. And I’m not in a hurry
to-night anyway.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf</span>—[<i>Finished with the door.</i>] If you please,
Mr. Juhasz, your maid telephoned a while ago to
ask why you were so late. Your supper is getting
spoiled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—There, you see.... Please don’t bother
about me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Not at all.... [<i>To <span class="smcap">Adolf</span>.</i>] Phone
and tell her that I shan’t be home for supper to-night.
I’ll go to a restaurant. [<i><span class="smcap">Adolf</span> exits
through the archway.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—You are quite right.... The empty
house and the vacant place at table....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Not that, but ... you see ... my
wife is very fond of asparagus ... and it’s out of
season and hard to get.... This afternoon I got
some ... the first asparagus to arrive in the city....
And I sent it home ... for supper ... a
surprise, you know.... Well ... now ... if I
go home ... what can I say to the maid?...
Shall I stand there and be ashamed ... of the
asparagus? [<i>A brief pause.</i>] Or shall I eat it
myself?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf</span>—[<i>In the archway.</i>] I am putting out the
lights, Mr. Juhasz.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>To <span class="smcap">Paula</span>, who is about to go.</i>] One
moment. [<i>To <span class="smcap">Adolf</span>.</i>] Wait, my son, there is something
I promised you. [<i>He takes the toy steamship
from under the counter, at right. He stands behind
the counter. <span class="smcap">Adolf</span> comes down in front of it.</i>]
Now, look here, my son. See this little lid? You
lift it up like that. See?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolf</span>—Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Begins in a matter-of-fact way, but
gradually his voice grows more sorrowful until, in
the end, it is trembling with suppressed sobs.</i>] In
here are two keys. This one winds up the wheels
when you want the ship to run along the floor. This
one winds up the propeller. See ... that is the
propeller. It makes the ship move through the
water ... if there is any water. The thing to
remember is that you mustn’t turn the key backwards,
for then the spring unwinds. And when you
wind it, you must wind it very slowly, just as you
wind a watch, very slowly.... [<i>He turns the key
three times while <span class="smcap">Adolf</span> watches absorbedly. Nothing
is heard but the click of the turning cog-wheels as
the curtain slowly, almost imperceptibly, falls.</i>]</p>

<p class="hanging">[<i>The <span class="smcap">Count’s</span> workroom in a little outbuilding
devoted to the business of the estate. A wide glass
door back center, with a window on either side of it,
looks on a terrace and a quaint old garden beyond.

<p class="noindent"><i>Up right stands the <span class="smcap">Count’s</span> huge desk and in

<p class="noindent"><i>It is a bright summer morning. The <span class="smcap">Count</span> sits

a report to him.</i>]</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Domokos</span>—And about that fellow, Mate. He’s
the most useless man about the place. An absolute
disgrace to the dairy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—And the favorite of Mr. Juhasz.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Domokos</span>—Yes, excellency. I’d have discharged
Mate long ago, but Mr. Juhasz won’t let me. He’s
sorry for the man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—Sorry for him!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Domokos</span>—Mate has such a glib tongue he always
manages to get around Mr. Juhasz somehow. But
this time ... he hadn’t turned up for three days.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
This morning he reported for work again, looking
very seedy. But this time we’ve caught him right.
I found this letter ... [<i>exhibits the letter</i>] which
proves beyond a doubt that Mate is the paid spy of
our competitor, Baron Goldberger.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—Goldberger!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Domokos</span>—Yes, of Baron Goldberger.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—Not <i>Baron</i> Goldberger....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Domokos</span>—Pardon me ... no. Of Goldberger.
And, if Mr. Juhasz doesn’t discharge him now....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—I’ll see to it. Where is this Mate? [<i>He
rings.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Domokos</span>—I told him to wait out there in the
little office. [<i>Points to the left.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—Give me that letter. [<i><span class="smcap">Domokos</span> gives it

Mr. Juhasz....</p>

Budapest three different times.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—That will do, Mate. Wait out there

you.</p>

have the rest of your report this afternoon....
I am busy now. Leave that letter here. [<i>Rings.</i>]
Where is Juhasz?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Domokos</span>—I saw him down near the hothouses.
I think he’s feeding the pigeons.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—Naturally.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Domokos</span>—Yes, sir. [<i>He exits at left as <span class="smcap">Paula</span>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—Good morning!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—Good morning, sunbeam. Quick, quick.
We can talk now. Your duenna is away ... feeding
the pigeons.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—Your excellency is always saying unkind
things about Mr. Juhasz. [<i>She sits at the typewriting
machine.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—And yet I love him as I would my own
son. [<i>Kisses <span class="smcap">Paula’s</span> hand.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—I must pretend to be working. If he
comes in and finds me just talking to you, he’ll be
unhappy again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—No fear of that now.... He is a long
way from here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—As if that mattered! He divines the fact
that we are together. And he can find me with his
eyes shut. [<i>Taps once or twice on the machine.</i>]
Please don’t let him catch us like this.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—This is intolerable, Paula. It can’t go
on. One of the reasons I sent for you was to tell
you that I mean to get rid of Juhasz to-day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—[<i>Sorrowfully.</i>] Your excellency....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—There is a dairyman named Mate, a
wholly untrustworthy fellow, whom he won’t dismiss.
That gives me a perfect excuse, and I intend to make
use of it. For I can’t let this sort of thing go on
indefinitely. He’s always on your heels like a watch-dog,
and I’m sick of it.... It isn’t enough that
he’s practically useless around the place ... but
he demoralizes everything with that benevolence of
his ... my dignity ... even my cheese.... And
to crown it all he makes me play the comedian in
my own house. In order to be alone with you I
must give you dictation. And in order to give you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
dictation I must make political speeches.... And
I detest political speeches....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—[<i>Listening.</i>] Wasn’t that the door?
He’s just come in the anteroom. Dictate to me!
Hurry!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—It’s enough to drive a man to despair.
[<i>Loudly, as <span class="smcap">Paula</span> types.</i>] “If the Minister of Agriculture
supposes ... that the farmers of the country
will tolerate ... such a thing, he is gravely mistaken.”
I’ll discharge him. I’ll discharge him this
very day.... No.... Don’t write that ... I
don’t mean the minister.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—[<i>As she writes.</i>] Don’t be unkind to him....
He’s such a dear, gentle soul.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—[<i>Loudly.</i>] The tiller of the soil asks
little of his Government....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—[<i>As she writes.</i>] It’s sheer gratitude
that makes him guard me so faithfully, gratitude to
me for having come here with him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—I’ve put up with his gratitude until I’m
weary of it. It’s four months since you came here.
Do you realize it? Four months you have tormented
me ... on his account. Four months you
have been postponing my happiness from day to
day ... on his account.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—You must be patient a little longer. He’ll
go of his own accord ... as soon as he gets his
fifty-one thousand kronen from Berlin. Meantime,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
I can’t let you be unkind to him ... no ... not
on my account.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—He’ll never get the money. And I can’t
wait. I am fifty-six, Paula, and desperately in
love ... in love, do you hear.... [<i>Comes nearer
to her.</i>] You beautiful ... young ... thing!
[<i><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span> enters at left with a big ledger under his
arm.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—I beg pardon. Shall I check up the
live-stock too?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—[<i>Crossly.</i>] Yes. [<i>To <span class="smcap">Paula</span>.</i>] “The
deplorable policies inaugurated by the Minister of
Agriculture....” [<i><span class="smcap">Paula</span> types.</i>] By the way,
Miss, is that detailed statement finished?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—Your excellency, my eyes have been
troubling me ... and ... I have only finished
with the summaries. [<i>Hands him a sheaf of closely
written documents.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—[<i>Affecting severity.</i>] You must manage
to get more work done, Miss Paula. Please be sure
to have the detailed statements ready for me by this
evening. [<i><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span> exits at left.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—He heard you as he came in. I’m sure
he heard you!... Oh, I’m so sorry!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—You needn’t be. It doesn’t matter any
more. I shan’t let him hinder me any longer. I
can’t afford to. I’m too old. The only thing left
to do is pay the fifty-one thousand kronen, give him
back his shop and be rid of him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—He won’t accept it. He’d rather starve.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—[<i>With a touch of exasperation.</i>] Curious
that your friends never have such scruples, only
your enemies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—Have you noticed how badly he looks?
That’s from worrying about me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—It’s from staying up nights, pacing to
and fro beneath my window. He has the bad taste
to suppose that I would seduce one of my employees
in my own house.... But ... sunbeam ... our
love deserves a worthier setting ... doesn’t it?...
A flight to Paris by the swiftest motor we can
find ... and from there southward to the sea ...
under the skies of Spain that God only made for
people to love under.... [<i>Comes nearer to her.
<span class="smcap">Juhasz</span> enters at left.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—I beg pardon. I only wanted to give
Miss Paula these.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—[<i>Crossly.</i>] Certainly. Certainly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Gives <span class="smcap">Paula</span> a bundle of closely written
pages.</i>] Here are the detailed statements his excellency
wants. Mr. Santha was kind enough to get
them up last night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—He did them for me? [<i>Looks at the
pages; smiles; to the <span class="smcap">Count</span>.</i>] Forty pages, all
closely written. Oh, that dear Mr. Santha! I don’t
know how to thank him. [<i>Gives the pages to the
<span class="smcap">Count</span>.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—[<i>Looks at them.</i>] Mr. Santha wrote
these?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—Wasn’t it darling of him? Think of it!
He must have worked all night, the poor——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—[<i>Comparing them with the summaries.</i>]
Curious how like these are the ones you wrote yourself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—Oh, I may as well confess it, your excellency.
I didn’t write those either. Mr. Juhasz did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—Oh? Juhasz did?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—It was only three pages ... and Miss
Paula’s eyes bothered her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—[<i>With a sheaf of pages in each hand.</i>]
So, then, Juhasz wrote these three pages, and Santha
wrote these forty?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—[<i>He rings. <span class="smcap">Santha</span> enters.</i>] Wait a
moment, Santha. [<i>To <span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>.</i>] There was a light
in your room until four this morning. What were
you doing up so late?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—I’m not a very successful liar, excellency.
I wrote the detailed statements too....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—Thank you, Santha. You may go.
[<i>He throws the statements on the table. <span class="smcap">Santha</span>
exits at left.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—I am very grateful to you, Mr. Juhasz.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Oh, I am glad to have been of service.
[<i>He exits at left.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—Tell me ... isn’t this Juhasz in love
with you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—[<i>In honest amazement.</i>] How can you
say such a thing? It is nothing but his goodness, his
exaggerated sense of gratitude. He thinks he owes
me his aid and his protection because I followed him
here into exile.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—I’ll exile him for good this time. Wait
and see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—You won’t be unkind to him ... please
... don’t be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—Don’t worry.... I’ll be absolutely just
with him. I’ll simply confront him with the case of
this fellow Mate whom he can’t bring himself to dismiss.
And I’ll say to him, “Now, it’s Mate or you.”
And as it is perfectly certain that he will never be
able to harden his heart to the point of dismissing
anyone, he’ll have no alternative but to go himself.
And then ... [<i>ardently</i>] my happiness begins ...
and yours, Paula ... for you are my last love
... and last love is like the setting sun ... full
of fire and gold.... [<i>He approaches her ardently.
<span class="smcap">Juhasz</span> enters at left, a big book under his
arm.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—The swine aren’t entered in the books.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—Oh!... There’s a limit to everything!
[<i>Goes to the door at left, calling angrily.</i>] Mr.
Santha! Didn’t I say I was not to be disturbed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
while dictating? Where is the fellow! [<i>Exits at
left, leaving the door open.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>To <span class="smcap">Paula</span>, quickly.</i>] I heard all the
dreadful things he said to you. And it’s my fault.
I brought you here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—But, Mr. Juhasz——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—I brought you here ... and now I don’t
know what to do.... I ... I’ll talk to him ...
and forbid him to——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—Please, Mr. Juhasz, don’t do anything
of the kind!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—He wants to get rid of me anyhow. I
know I’m in his way ... because he wants you....
But don’t worry, my child, I shan’t let him <i>drive</i>
me away. [<i>The <span class="smcap">Count</span> enters at left.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—Absolutely demoralized! All of them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—The swine....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—Don’t bother me now with your swine.
Come back later. [<i><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span> exits at left.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—It gets worse all the time. He used to
give us at least a few minutes together, but now he
keeps popping in like a—— [<i>Stops, enraged, for
a word.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—He heard what you said to me before.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—Did he say anything to you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—He promised to ... watch you closer
than ever ... from now on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—That’s an insult to you! Why don’t you
forbid it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—I thought of doing it, but when he looks
at you ... with those soft, kind eyes of his——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—I know. He has eyes like a devoted
horse. I can’t endure them either.... But now
I’ve had enough. The thing must end to-day. If
he comes in once more, you must go out, my dear,
and leave me alone with him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—He won’t come in again. You made it
plain to him that he mustn’t.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—You don’t know him. He’ll be in the
moment he hears what he is listening for. I’m perfectly
certain he’s listening. [<i>Goes toward the door
at left.</i>] Watch. [<i>Loudly.</i>] Paula, I wonder if
you know how sweet, how charming, how utterly
adorable you are. [<i>Approaches the door as he
speaks.</i>] [<i><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span> enters quickly, determinedly at
left. When he sees the <span class="smcap">Count</span> standing there, smiling
sarcastically, he stops short in the doorway,
abashed.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—May I talk to you about the swine now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—Come in. [<i>To <span class="smcap">Paula</span>, sternly.</i>] Make
a copy of what I have dictated, Miss Paula.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—Yes, sir. [<i>Rises, gathers up her papers.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—[<i>Sternly.</i>] A clean and correct copy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—Yes, your excellency. [<i>She exits at
right.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—The swine, your excellency——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—Never mind that, Juhasz.... There
is something else I want to talk with you about....
There are many complaints against you. Very
many!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—I know your excellency isn’t satisfied
with me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—But my pigeons are satisfied, eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Is that what you are displeased about,
sir?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—You feed them too much. They are so
fat they won’t fly any more. And when I ask for
a pigeon for my luncheon I am informed that Mr.
Juhasz won’t permit one to be killed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—I’m so sorry for the poor soft little
creatures....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—And aren’t you sorry for the poor soft
little ox?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—I don’t know him personally, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—Humph!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—It doesn’t seem right to me ... to eat
your personal acquaintances.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—[<i>Significantly.</i>] It does to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—If that’s the only complaint....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—It isn’t. There are many more. You
and I will have to part company, Juhasz. I can’t
keep you here any longer.... Now every time I
broach the subject ... you look at me like that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Averts his eyes.</i>] I’m sorry, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—[<i>Irritably.</i>] I once had a horse named
Trafalgar. He was just like you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Like me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—He broke his leg ... and I couldn’t have
him shot because he used to look at me ... exactly
as you do. [<i>In spite of himself, <span class="smcap">Juhasz</span> looks at
him.</i>] Don’t look at me like that! I forbid it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Looking away.</i>] Yes, your excellency.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—[<i>Consults a memorandum.</i>] Here is a
long list of your offenses. First, there’s that potter,
Mano Steiner, who owes us eight thousand kronen.
You granted him an extension of one year. What
for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Pots, your excellency.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—I know that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—And the poor fellow has had so much
trouble of late.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—Trouble?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Business trouble.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—You have no right to be charitable at
my expense.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Wasn’t there some other complaint, too,
sir?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—Yes, lots of them. [<i>Consults the memorandum.</i>]
You owe three hundred and thirty kronen
to the all-night café.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Not for myself, excellency.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—I know. You assumed that fellow Mate’s
debts. And now that he has credit again he has
resumed his drinking.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Oh, your excellency, he didn’t owe the
three hundred and thirty kronen for drinks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—For what, then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—For hard-boiled eggs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—Is that what he told you? Let me see.
That would make 640 hard-boiled eggs in a single
month. Or twenty-one a day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Yes, the poor fellow has to eat twenty-two
every day. The doctor has put him on an egg
diet.... But that bill at the café is paid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—Juhasz, Juhasz, it’s sinful the way you let
people rob you. I suppose you haven’t a heller to
your name.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Well, just at present——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—I thought so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—What is next on the list, your excellency?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—The next is very serious. It concerns
your protégé, Mate. We have discovered that he is
Goldberger’s spy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—I don’t believe it, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—[<i>Picks up a letter.</i>] Perhaps this letter,
written in his own hand, may convince you. It is
written to Goldberger, acknowledging the receipt of
two hundred kronen in payment for a full list of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
our customers.... There is no possible doubt
about it now.... The foreman wanted the man
discharged a month ago, but you refused to permit
it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—But I didn’t know he had done this,
your excellency.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—Well, you know it now. And I trust you
have no further doubt that the man must be dismissed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Well ... if he has done this ... then
... I think the foreman ought to dismiss him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—The foreman ought? Oh, no, Juhasz!
You’ll dismiss him yourself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Aghast.</i>] I?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—It’s your last chance. Here is the letter.
[<i>Gives it to him.</i>] Mate is waiting out there. You
will tell him he is dismissed. [<i>Rings.</i>] I’ll be back
in five minutes. If Mate is dismissed I’ll be willing
to believe that there is some hope you may mend
your ways. If he’s not dismissed, then, my son, you
and I part company. [<i><span class="smcap">Santha</span> enters.</i>] Send
Mate in here. [<i><span class="smcap">Santha</span> exits at left.</i>] Five minutes!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Excellency, may I ask one favor?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Make it ... ten minutes. It’s not so
easy for me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—Very good. Ten minutes. [<i>Takes out
his watch.</i>] What time have you got?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Takes out his watch.</i>] Ten-thirty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—At ten-forty Mate is dismissed or you
leave this place to-day. [<i>He exits at back. Left
alone, <span class="smcap">Juhasz</span> scratches his head ruefully. <span class="smcap">Paula</span>
enters at right.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—For goodness’ sake, Paula ... don’t
come in now ... every moment is precious....
[<i>Pushes her gently toward the door at right.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—What’s the matter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—I’ve no time to lose now.... I’ve got
to hurt someone ... very much ... in order to be
able to stay near you ... and protect you. Don’t
ask me. [<i>Pushes her toward the door.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—What has happened? [<i><span class="smcap">Mate</span> enters at
right.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—The Count thinks he knows me. But this
time I’ll show him he’s wrong. Give me your hand.
Give me strength. [<i>Clasps her hand.</i>] Go now,
Paula, and rely on me.... You shall see how strong
I can be. In ten minutes it will be over. [<i><span class="smcap">Paula</span>
exits at right. <span class="smcap">Juhasz</span> closes the door behind her,
pauses a moment to collect his courage, then, without
turning to face <span class="smcap">Mate</span>, bellows at him.</i>] So there you
are!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mate</span>—I’ve got regards for you, boss, from Budapest.
I was in your shop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Never mind that now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mate</span>—I bought a necktie there. [<i>Shows his
cravat.</i>] Maybe you recognize it. The people all
sent their regards.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Never mind that now, please....
[<i>Fingers the cravat.</i>] Thanks, but we have something
else to discuss just now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mate</span>—[<i>Genially.</i>] They told me business was
fine.... And they are all expecting you back soon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Now, Mate, please don’t keep interrupting.
I’ve something very serious—— [<i>Flourishes
the letter.</i>] You have caused me a great deal of
trouble, Mate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mate</span>—[<i>Smoothly.</i>] Oh, don’t say that, boss!
I’d rather be dead than cause you any trouble.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Distressed.</i>] Now don’t talk like
that——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mate</span>—But, if——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>With determination.</i>] Be still now.
And let me talk.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mate</span>—[<i>With an injured expression.</i>] All right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Relenting.</i>] Or ... what were you
going to say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mate</span>—[<i>Aggrieved.</i>] Oh, nothing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—I didn’t mean to be rude. I am a bit
excited, you see. [<i>Flourishes the letter.</i>] This letter
was just handed to me. [<i>Looks at it.</i>] You took
... two hundred kronen ... from Baron Goldberger.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
[<i>Shows it to him.</i>] Is this your handwriting?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mate</span>—If you say it is——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Mate, don’t make it harder for me. It’s
painful enough as it is. And I have so little time....
Is this your handwriting?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mate</span>—Well, yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—There, you see! [<i>A brief pause. He
looks at his watch.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mate</span>—Well, I know what to expect. Get it
over with.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—You are a traitor, Mate. This letter
proves it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mate</span>—That’s all right. You can discharge me
if you want to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Why do you make it harder for me,
Mate? Do you think I like to do this?... You
don’t even say a word in your own defense.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mate</span>—What’s the use of my saying anything?
I know that I’ve got the sack.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—But how could you do such a thing?
<i>Why</i> did you do it? <i>Why?</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mate</span>—If I told you, you wouldn’t believe me.
I’m a liar, I am. Everybody says so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Don’t be so pig-headed! Did you ...
perhaps ... need the money for something urgent?...
You haven’t a family, have you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mate</span>—I have a crippled father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—There! I knew there was something.
Why didn’t you say so? Have you no faith in me?
[<i>Fingers <span class="smcap">Mate’s</span> cravat.</i>] What did they ask you
for this necktie?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mate</span>—Four kronen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Why, it only sells for three!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mate</span>—I only paid two.... There are so many
wicked people in the world, Mr. Juhasz. I’d have
been a different man if I’d ’a been treated right ...
but I wasn’t.... Everybody around here was always
down on me.... And now they’ve got me where
they want me....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>With heat.</i>] Have they? Not yet.
Make no mistake about that. [<i>Pumping up his determination.</i>]
So you have a crippled father?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mate</span>—Yes, my poor father!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—It seems to me I heard you were an
orphan.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mate</span>—They say all kinds of things about me
around here. My father lives in Szentes. If you
can call it living. [<i>Working himself up into a passion.</i>]
If you must know, I sent the two hundred
kronen to him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Eagerly.</i>] Can you prove that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mate</span>—Certainly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—How?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mate</span>—By this. [<i>Shows him a photograph.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—By this? This is a photograph.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mate</span>—Of my father. The picture of my poor
old father.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—But this is a photograph of the actor,
Girardi.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mate</span>—They resemble each other a lot. Everybody
says so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Thoughtfully.</i>] Hum! And what does
this prove?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mate</span>—That he’s the one ... I sent the dirty
money to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Undeceived.</i>] No, Mate. You are
lying to me. [<i>Returns the photograph to him.</i>]
This is unpardonable.... They were perfectly
right in what they said about you. [<i>Looks at his
watch.</i>] You are dismissed, Mate ... and now you
may go. [<i>Does not trust himself to look at <span class="smcap">Mate</span>,
but gives him a shove toward the door.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mate</span>—[<i>Kisses the photograph.</i>] Poor father!
Who’ll send you money now ... the first of every
month?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Greatly distressed.</i>] Please ... stop
that ... and go!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mate</span>—And my poor little girl ... who’ll feed
her now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—You have a child, too?... I don’t want
to hear about it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mate</span>—I didn’t say anything to you. [<i>Starts to
go.</i>] My poor, sick little girl!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Restrains him; greatly distressed.</i>] Is
she ill?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mate</span>—What do you care?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—How old is she?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mate</span>—[<i>Dries his eyes.</i>] Two years old. Her
mother is dead. We planted flowers on her grave.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—This is harrowing.... I know you are
lying again.... I mustn’t listen to you. [<i>Looks
at his watch.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mate</span>—A little blonde baby. With hair like flax.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Ten-thirty-six. You are dismissed.
[<i>Puts his hands over his ears.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mate</span>—She always says to me, “Papa ... Papa
send money.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—I’m not listening to you.... You are
lying.... But I can’t hear you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mate</span>—My poor innocent angel. Her medicines
alone cost me.... Oh, how <i>can</i> a man go straight
when he has a crippled father and a sick baby to
keep?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Takes his hands from his ears.</i>] I
didn’t hear you.... You are dismissed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mate</span>—The doctor prescribed sulphur for her
... and milk.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—I’m not listening.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mate</span>—No.... But I wish I knew how to close
my ears when my poor hungry baby cries, “Papa,
papa....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>At the end of his endurance.</i>] Liar!...
You are dismissed.... [<i>Reconsiders it, angrily.</i>]
You are not dismissed! Oh, how can I tell
whether you are lying or not?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mate</span>—[<i>Low, reproachfully.</i>] Oh, Mr. Juhasz!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Angrily.</i>] Be still! [<i>Less angrily.</i>]
Sit down. [<i>Less angrily yet.</i>] Have a cigarette.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mate</span>—[<i>Drying his eyes.</i>] I only smoke cigars.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Crossly pushes the humidor toward
him.</i>] There! [<i><span class="smcap">Mate</span> takes one.</i>] Not those....
[<i>Shouts.</i>] Take a Havana. [<i><span class="smcap">Mate</span> sticks several
in his pocket.</i>] Stop that crying.... And tell me
instead, whether you are lying to me or not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mate</span>—[<i>Snivelling.</i>] When all a man earns is
eighty kronen a month....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—I know, I know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mate</span>—And has to send forty to his father, and
thirty to his sick boy.... [<i>as <span class="smcap">Juhasz</span> makes a gesture
of surprise</i>] I mean girl ... what has he got
left? Ten kronen! Can you live on ten kronen a
month?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—It’s terrible, I know.... Mate....
[<i>Scratches his head in bewilderment.</i>] I wish I knew
what to do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mate</span>—If I had anything left to pawn ... but
I haven’t.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Feels involuntarily for his watch<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
chain.</i>] If I had any money myself.... But just
at present ... I regret to say....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mate</span>—[<i>His eyes fixed on <span class="smcap">Juhasz’s</span> chain.</i>] If I
had a watch ... or a chain....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Takes out his watch.</i>] What’s the matter
with your baby?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mate</span>—It’s anæmic.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Poor child! [<i>Takes his watch off the
chain.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mate</span>—[<i>Watching him greedily.</i>] That comes
from being undernourished.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Gives him the watch.</i>] What the child
needs is plenty of fresh milk.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mate</span>—[<i>Regarding the watch in his palm with
pretended amazement.</i>] What’s this?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—A gold watch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mate</span>—[<i>Offers to return it.</i>] But, please——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Stop annoying me! [<i>Pushes it back.</i>]
The pawnbroker will lend you a hundred kronen on
it.... Some day, when you have the money, you
can redeem it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mate</span>—But, Mr. Juhasz——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Take it. You can’t get anything on the
chain. It’s plated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mate</span>—[<i>Pockets the watch. His voice is tearful.</i>]
People like you, Mr. Juhasz, give a man faith
again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Stop your crying.... I’ll speak to his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
excellency about you. Maybe I can persuade him
to keep you on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mate</span>—He’s a good-hearted man.... I’d have
spoken to him myself only—— [<i>With a hopeless
gesture he indicates his tattered coat.</i>] I couldn’t
let him see me in this condition.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Grasps both lapels of his own coat;
despairingly.</i>] The man will have the coat off my
back!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mate</span>—[<i>Takes a protesting stride toward him.</i>]
But Mr. Juhasz ... you don’t suppose that I——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—No, no ... but stop talking like that
... or I’ll have to take it off.... Merciful heaven!
To think that such poverty exists in our very midst!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mate</span>—[<i>Weeping.</i>] You have made a better man
of me, Mr. Juhasz.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—There ... there, my boy ... don’t
worry ... everything will be all right.... Just
rely on me.... I’ll take care of you. [<i>Puts an
arm about him; his voice quavers with tenderness and
pity.</i>] Come what may, I’ll help you. [<i>The <span class="smcap">Count</span>
appears in the doorway at back.</i>] We’ll overlook
what you have done ... and I’ll see to it that your
wages are raised. [<i>The <span class="smcap">Count</span> enters. Seeing him,
<span class="smcap">Juhasz</span> lets his arm fall from <span class="smcap">Mate’s</span> shoulder.
There is a pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—Is this the way you dismiss the man,
Mr. Juhasz?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>In great embarrassment.</i>] Your excellency....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—I gave you ten minutes to do it in.
What time is it now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Involuntarily feels for his watch.</i>]
The ten minutes ... are up, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—Where’s your watch?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—My watch?... Er....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—You had it ten minutes ago. [<i>To
<span class="smcap">Mate</span>.</i>] Have <i>you</i> got it? [<i><span class="smcap">Mate</span> nods, abashed.</i>]
Give it here. [<i><span class="smcap">Mate</span> gives it to him.</i>] Now get out
of here. And don’t let me see your face about my
place again. [<i><span class="smcap">Mate</span> slinks out at left.</i>] So you
forgave him? [<i><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span> is silent.</i>] And promised
to raise his wages? [<i><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span> is silent.</i>] And gave
him the watch you got from me ten years ago?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Excellency, I couldn’t help it.... I
can’t bear to see people suffer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—Juhasz, you can’t stay here any longer.
I’ll give you six months’ wages in lieu of notice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—I don’t want to be paid for leaving....
I’ll go just the same....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—[<i>Crossly.</i>] I can’t send you away without
a kreutzer to your name! What the devil <i>is</i>
one to do with you? Anyone else in your place
would have been thrown out bodily, but you!...
[<i>Roars at him.</i>] Am I to throw you out because
you have the disposition of a saint!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—You needn’t throw me out, sir. I’m
going of my own account.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—[<i>Angrily.</i>] Hold your tongue! You
are too damned good for this world!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Pacifyingly.</i>] You oughtn’t excite
yourself, excellency.... There is really no need for
it ... and you might bring on a stroke——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—It’s all very well to be soft-hearted and
charitable and forgiving. I’d like to be that way
myself. But it’s a luxury I can’t afford.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—I’m no use around here.... I know
that, sir——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—[<i>Shouts.</i>] Don’t look at me like that!
This is unheard of! I come in with the fixed intention
of giving you the sack, and here I am—— Unheard
of! [<i>Angrier yet.</i>] Now I’m the Juhasz!
[<i>Roars.</i>] Do you expect me to send you away because
you try to help everybody who is in trouble?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—A man like me does more harm around
the place than a hundred lazy workmen.... You
mustn’t consider me, sir.... I’ll be all right. I’ll
go somewhere and wait until my money comes ...
from Berlin. Then I’ll have my shop back. [<i>He
raises his eyes to the <span class="smcap">Count</span>, then recollects that it is
forbidden.</i>] I beg pardon. [<i>He turns his back.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—Such credulity! Such optimism! [<i>Goes
up to him.</i>] You are the most absurd old baby I
ever—— You can look at me now ... you soft-hearted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
[<i><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span> looks at him</i>] old lamb, you....
The only thing to do with you ... is ... hug
you. [<i>Puts an arm affectionately around <span class="smcap">Juhasz’s</span>
shoulder. <span class="smcap">Paula</span> enters at right. Seeing her, the
<span class="smcap">Count</span> withdraws his arm. There is a brief pause.</i>]
I’m a fine dismisser myself! [<i>To <span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>.</i>] Run
along, my son ... go out to your pigeons ... and
tell them that the old master can’t eat his personal
acquaintances either. [<i><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span> flashes <span class="smcap">Paula</span> a triumphant
glance and exits quickly at left.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—If I had come in a minute later you’d
have been kissing him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—Quite likely. It’s no use. I can’t get
rid of him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—I’ve thought of a way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—To get him out of here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—Yes, and of his own free will.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—It isn’t possible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—It is. But it will cost a great deal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—I’ll pay whatever it costs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—Mr. Juhasz can have his shop back by
paying fifty-one thousand kronen to the attorney
for his creditors.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—But, my dear, you said yourself that he’d
never let me pay it for him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—Yes, but he is not to know that you are
paying it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—Who then——</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—He must be made to believe that the
money was sent by the person from whom he’s expecting
it. From Oscar Mezei ... in Berlin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—I see. Not bad!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—Very simple. Have your cashier put
fifty-one thousand kronen in an envelope and with it
a notification that the money comes from a Berlin
bank. Can he do that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—[<i>Enthusiastically.</i>] I’ll make him do it.
And as soon as Juhasz gets the money——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—He will hurry with it to the city ... to
pay off his creditors ... and take over his shop
... and stay in it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—If we hurry, perhaps we can get him off
by the noon train. I’ll see the cashier at once. The
whole thing shouldn’t take more than ten minutes
to fabricate.... You have made me very happy,
dear. This clever plan of yours is the first real
intimation that you, too, want to be rid of Juhasz.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—Rid of him! That’s a hideous way to
put it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—Put it as you like, the fact is there. It
is perfectly natural for me to be impatient ... but
for you to be is ... charming.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—It isn’t impatience ... as much as ...
uneasiness. When I look at him ... sometimes
... I feel a twinge of doubt. When I see how
pathetically he tries to protect me ... from you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
... I get a twinge of remorse. It will be different
when he has gone.... Yet I shouldn’t want to see
him go empty handed.... And neither would I
want him ... ever to find out that——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—Rely on me. The papers shall be forged
carefully enough to deceive a bank president. I’ll go
to the cashier this minute.... Paula, you have
made me very happy. [<i>He takes her hand and kisses
it.</i>] If I were twenty years younger I suppose I
would have kissed you on that red, young mouth
of yours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—Careful! Someone is coming.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—[<i>Still holding her hand; is about to kiss
her.</i>] No....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—I heard the outer door.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—Nonsense! [<i>As he bends toward her
again <span class="smcap">Juhasz</span> enters at left.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Excellency, some of the pigeons have
flown away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—[<i>Does not resent this interruption; very
jovially.</i>] No matter, Juhasz, they’ll come back.
[<i>He exits at left. There is a pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—He touched you.... He touched you
with his hands.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—He kissed my hand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—If I hadn’t come in he would have kissed
your cheek. This can’t go on, you poor child, you
are in serious danger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—Aren’t you exaggerating, Mr. Juhasz?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Is it possible you don’t understand that
he is trying to make you his mistress?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—It takes two to make that bargain, Mr.
Juhasz.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Two to make it, but only one to repent
it.... You don’t seem to realize the game he is
playing with you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—He has always behaved like a gentleman
with me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—That is the most dangerous part of it.
These rich people have such fine manners ... they
are like silkworms ... they spin a fine soft thread
around a poor girl ... and she never realizes what
they are about ... until one day she wakes up and
finds herself ... dressed in silk.... But I won’t
let that happen to you. And the Count knows it.
That is why he is trying to get rid of me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—Why, he loves you like a son. Just now
he was embracing you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—But he’ll send me away, sooner or later.
I know that. And this is what I want to say to you.
Philip telegraphed that he is coming down to see me
this afternoon. I’m going back to the city with
him. I might as well before I’m driven out. And
you are coming with me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—I?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Yes. You can’t stay here any longer.
It is too dangerous for you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—Dangerous! That’s perfectly absurd.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Haven’t I seen and heard enough to
know? All his advances! All his proposals!
Have you ever seen a little bird fluttering helplessly
about in a lion’s cage?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Neither have I. But I imagine it must
be like you are here.... I am going to take you
out of here, my child.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—That’s awfully good of you, Mr. Juhasz,
but——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Do you <i>want</i> to stay here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—I see no reason why I shouldn’t.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—I am the better judge of that. And I
shan’t let you stay.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—I appreciate your motives, Mr. Juhasz.
But pardon me if I say you have no right to decide
whether I may stay or go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—No right? Didn’t I bring you here ...
into this danger?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—Perhaps I came ... of my own accord.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—I see. His insidious poison has begun
to work on you already. Well, Paula, I won’t have
it that way. You have never seen me determined
yet.... Perhaps I never was before.... But I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
am now.... Paula [<i>with a burst of courage</i>], I’ll
take you with me by force if necessary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—I repeat ... you have no right to do
that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>At a loss for the moment.</i>] No right
... no right?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—You are not my father ... or any relation
of mine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—I ... I....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—I used to work for you ... and I respect
you deeply ... but apart from that——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—I love you, Paula.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—Yes, but——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—You don’t understand, Paula. [<i>Pauses
a moment before he repeats very simply and earnestly.</i>]
I love you. [<i>A pause.</i>] That is why I
dared to say such things. [<i>A pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—Why, Mr. Juhasz——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—You are surprised.... You thought I
kept watch over you quite unselfishly ... like a
brother.... Well, so I did ... at first.... I
used to pace up and down beneath the Count’s window
... all night long ... without a thought in
my mind except to keep you from harm.... Sometimes
I was tired and sleepy ... but there I stayed
... under his window ... because it was my duty
to protect you ... and then ... gradually ...
I began to realize ... that I liked to watch ...<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
that I was never tired or sleepy any more ... my
whole attitude had changed ... but I didn’t tell
you.... I still pretended to be guarding you ...
only because I had your interest at heart ... while
all the time it was because I loved you.... And
now ... you can send me away, if you like.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—Mr. Juhasz ... I don’t know ... I
really don’t know what to say.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—You never guessed it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—I would never have believed it, if you
hadn’t——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—I didn’t mean to tell you. But when
you said I had no right ... it slipped out.... I
might have gone on pretending.... I don’t know....
But now I can ask you again ... to come
with me ... if you will ... as my wife. [<i>A
pause.</i>] Won’t you answer me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—I have been pretending, too, Mr. Juhasz.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—You?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—I let you think I came here ... out of
loyalty to you. But I didn’t. I came because I
wanted to come ... because I am bad and depraved.
And that is why I want to stay.... I am
sick of poverty, Mr. Juhasz.... I don’t want to
go back to work in a dingy little office ... of a
dingy little shop.... I am young, Mr. Juhasz, and
pretty.... I want to do the things that make living
worth while ... meet interesting people ...<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
see beautiful places ... wear fine clothes ... enjoy
the leisure and luxury that only rich folks can
have.... I have thought about such things ...
and longed for them so fiercely ... that it makes
me cold and sick ... only to think that I may not
have them.... Oh, it’s so difficult to tell you, Mr.
Juhasz! My heart is so heavy!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Do you ... love the count?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Tell me the truth.... You can tell me
now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—He isn’t a man to me at all. He is only
the door that leads into a new life.... He is rich,
Mr. Juhasz, rich, rich—— [<i>Hides her face in shame
on his shoulder.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Half dazed.</i>] Come with me ... and
I will be rich, too.... I will work for you, Paula,
as no man ever worked before.... There are people
who will help me.... I will be ambitious, grasping
... until I have all the money you want....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—[<i>Still has her face buried in his shoulder.</i>]
And by the time you had made your money I should
be too old to want it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Bitterly.</i>] After all, you are right,
Paula. I am absurd. Another man would offer to
lay down his life for the woman he loved.... I
offer to open an account in a savings bank. [<i>She
raises her head. There is a knock at the door.</i>]<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
Come in. [<i>Louder.</i>] Come in! [<i><span class="smcap">Santha</span> enters
at left, carrying an envelope and two receipts.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santha</span>—Pardon me, Mr. Juhasz, but the cashier
sent this in. Will you sign this receipt, please?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Yes.... I’ll be there in a moment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santha</span>—You need only——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Don’t you see I’m busy? Tell the cashier
I’ll be there in a moment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santha</span>—It isn’t necessary. Just take this, and
sign. [<i>Proffers the envelope and the receipts.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Looks at them.</i>] Isn’t this an error?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santha</span>—It is addressed to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Reads.</i>] From the Deutsche Bank, of
Berlin ... to the Ungarische Allgemeine Credit-bank
... to the account of Mr. Peter Juhasz ...
from Mr. Oscar Mezei, of Berlin.... [<i>The hand
holding the receipt sinks slowly. <span class="smcap">Juhasz</span> himself
sinks into a chair, then raises the receipt to his eyes
again, very slowly, as if his arm were tired.</i>] From
Oscar Mezei, Berlin ... fifty-one thousand kronen.
[<i>He looks into the envelope; sees the sheaf of banknotes
there.</i>] Didn’t I tell you, Santha? I always
said he’d send it. But you all laughed at me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santha</span>—Will you sign the receipt, please?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Rather dazed.</i>] Certainly. [<i>He
signs.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santha</span>—[<i>Takes the signed receipt; leaves the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
other in <span class="smcap">Juhasz’s</span> hand.</i>] You keep this one. It’s
the duplicate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—The duplicate ... yes. Where are you
going?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santha</span>—To give this back to the cashier.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Oh, yes. Thank you, Santha.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santha</span>—Don’t mention it, sir. [<i>He exits.
There is a pause. <span class="smcap">Juhasz</span> stands at left. <span class="smcap">Paula</span>
is at extreme right. He looks at her, still balancing
the envelope full of banknotes on his palm.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—I congratulate you, Mr. Juhasz. [<i>He is
silent.</i>] Now you can have your shop back, and
everything will be all right for you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Crosses to her.</i>] Yes, Paula, now
everything will be all right for me. And for you,
too. For now I can give you the things you want
... fine clothes and beautiful places and all the
rest.... Take it, Paula.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—Mr. Juhasz ... your shop, your creditors——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—What do I want the shop for now? Let
the creditors sell it out. There will be more than
enough to pay them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—But that means your livelihood, your entire
future!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—I love you, Paula. It is <i>your</i> future I
am thinking of. You don’t want to work in a shop
... or be a shopkeeper’s wife ... you want to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
live in luxury ... well ... here is money. Take
it. [<i>Forces it into her hand.</i>] There! Close your
hand.... Spend it ... while it lasts ... and
then ... if you still want to go on living that way
... it will be easy to get more money ... too
easy for a pretty girl like you.... But if you
change your mind, Paula, if you change your mind,
you can turn back ... back to this ordinary life....
But if you took the Count’s money, there could
be no turning back.... Don’t you see?... For
when a girl’s honor is gone ... she can’t turn back....
And you will want to turn back.... I am certain
of that.... I know you, Paula.... You will
want to turn back.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—[<i>Deeply moved.</i>] You would do this
for me? You would give me everything you possess
... and ask nothing in return?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Throwing it off, with a whimsical
smile.</i>] Everything I possess? So it is. Let the
Count do as much for you if he’s such a cavalier.
[<i><span class="smcap">Paula</span> offers him the money, mutely.</i>] No. We
are going now ... we shall both make the noon
train to Budapest.... You will not stay here with
the Count.... I see it in your eyes ... in your
tears.... You are saved, little Paula, ... saved
from your own folly. [<i>He has moved very close to
her and has one hand on her shoulder when the <span class="smcap">Count<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span></span>
enters. <span class="smcap">Juhasz</span> drops his hand. There is a pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—Are you dictating, Juhasz?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Cold, resolute but respectful.</i>] I have
had very good news, your excellency. I am leaving
on the noon express ... and ... [<i>looks at
<span class="smcap">Paula</span></i>] Miss Paula will tell you the rest. [<i>Head
high, very sure of himself, he exits at right. There
is a pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—What’s the matter with the man?
[<i><span class="smcap">Paula</span> shows him the money.</i>] I don’t understand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—He gave it to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—I said he was in love with you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—Here! [<i>She offers him the money.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—Why? What’s this for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—It’s your money.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—No.... It belonged to Juhasz ...
and if he gave it to you ... and you accepted
it....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—I didn’t accept it.... I was too overcome
to speak. This money means to him his shop,
his future, the honor of his name ... and yet he
tossed it to me without a moment’s hesitation. I
never knew a man could love like that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—What are you going to do with it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—Give it back to him, of course.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—I wouldn’t do that.... He’d only try
to give it back to you again, or tear it up, or throw
it away.... The man’s in love with you, you know.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
... I think it were wiser to send the money at once
by telegraph to the attorney for his creditors. Then
we’ll be sure he will reap the benefit of it. We must
give him back his shop ... by force ... if that’s
the only way he’ll have it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—You are right. You are perfectly right.
I’ll give the money to the cashier myself, and have
him send it right off.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—I would.... Have you been crying,
Paula?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—It wasn’t exactly amusing ... to have
him offer to make a sacrifice like that ... after all
we had done to deceive him. [<i><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span> enters at right.
He is carrying his hat and umbrella.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Doubtless your excellency knows everything.
[<i><span class="smcap">Paula</span> exits at left.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—No, Juhasz. All I know is that you got
some money from Berlin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Proudly, firmly.</i>] Yes, and thank God
it came in time to rescue that poor girl from your
dishonorable attentions. She doesn’t need your
money now. She has mine, mine that was earned by
hard, honest labor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—Juhasz!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—I’m sorry to be compelled to speak to
you like this, excellency. God knows I am grateful
to you for all you have done for me, but I am leaving
your house, and Paula is coming with me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—She is going with you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Yes, your excellency.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—Do you think it wise to give her all your
money?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—It was my own money. I do what I want
with it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—My dear Juhasz, you are riding a very
high horse. I mention it only because the fall is apt
to be painful. Have you made sure that lady has
accepted your generous gift? [<i><span class="smcap">Paula</span> enters quietly
at left.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—I don’t know what you mean.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—Perhaps it would be best to ask her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Paula, his excellency ... just said
something ... I didn’t understand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—I couldn’t take it, Mr. Juhasz.... I
couldn’t....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Couldn’t take it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—I have sent the money to Budapest ...
by telegraph ... to the attorney for your creditors.
[<i>There is a pause. The <span class="smcap">Count</span> exits at back
on tiptoe.</i>] You didn’t give me a chance to speak
before.... I appreciate what you tried to do for
me ... any woman would ... but I couldn’t let
you ruin yourself on my account.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Puts the worst construction on her refusal.</i>]
He can give you more.... That’s true
enough! [<i>She does not answer. There is a pause.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>

<p><span class="smcap">Santha</span>—There he is. [<i><span class="smcap">Santha</span> exits.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—Good morning, Mr. Juhasz. Did you get
my telegram? [<i>He bows curtly to <span class="smcap">Paula</span>.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—I got it, Philip. How are you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—I met his excellency in the garden. He
said I would find you here. Am I interrupting?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—No, Philip. I was only saying good-bye
to Miss Paula.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—[<i>Cordially.</i>] Are you still angry with
me, Philip?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—[<i>Very earnestly; bows coldly.</i>] Yes, I
am. [<i>To <span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>.</i>] I am glad to hear that you are
coming to Budapest. That’s what I came for. To
ask you to come to town for a day or two.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—How are things at the shop?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—[<i>Ignoring her.</i>] That’s really what I
came for. I hope you don’t mind my saying, Mr.
Juhasz ... that business has been wonderful since
you went away. The receiver——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Mr. Geiringer?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—Yes.... Mr. Geiringer has been collecting
all the old outstanding accounts and keeping
a sharp eye on the cash. He sent me down here to
see you, Mr. Juhasz. It seems he has fallen in love
with the shop, and has been wanting to buy it for
himself. And when he found out that Mr. Oscar had
gone bankrupt in Berlin, he decided——</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—What’s that? What did Mr. Geiringer
find out?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—That Oscar had gone into bankruptcy
... then he went straight to the lawyer for your
creditors.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Excitedly.</i>] Slowly, please. You say
that Oscar went bankrupt in Berlin?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—Yes. Didn’t you know it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Looking at <span class="smcap">Paula</span>.</i>] No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—I’m sorry to have been the first to tell
you ... but everyone in the city knows it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—You are quite sure?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—Well, his wife has been back in Budapest,
living with her mother, for the past two weeks....
And I see Oscar every day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Are they divorced?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—No, but they are so hard up that they
have to live at her mother’s house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—If that’s so, there has been a terrible
mistake somewhere. [<i>He looks again at <span class="smcap">Paula</span>;
takes out the receipt, crosses to <span class="smcap">Philip</span>.</i>] Read
this.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—I’ll leave you alone. [<i>She starts for the
door.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Takes her by the hand.</i>] No, Paula,
you will stay here, please.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—[<i>Reading the notice.</i>] The Deutsche
Bank ... Oscar Mezei ... fifty-one thousand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
kronen [<i>in great astonishment.</i>] I can’t understand
this at all.... He had so little to show
when they put him in bankruptcy that he was lucky
not to be sent to prison ... and since then he has
been wandering around Budapest in shabby clothes,
borrowing a krone from anybody who’d lend him....
Why, I lent him two myself the day before
yesterday. [<i>There is a pause.</i>] Did this money
really arrive?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Has not taken his eyes off <span class="smcap">Paula</span>.</i>]
Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—I can’t make that out at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—You had to find out sooner or later, Mr.
Juhasz.... The money didn’t come from Oscar
Mezei.... It didn’t come from Berlin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Where <i>did</i> it come from?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—His excellency wanted to help you....
He sent you the money ... and had those bank
notices written here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Written here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—Yes.... You see——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—You knew it all the time?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—I was happy to see you get your shop
back, and——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—You knew it was all a pretext to get
rid of me? You knew it wasn’t my money?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—Yes, I knew it, Mr. Juhasz.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—And while I was saying those boastful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
things to you ... and making sacrifices for you
... with another man’s money ... you were inwardly
laughing at me all the time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—I cried, Mr. Juhasz.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—It wasn’t necessary to cry or to laugh,
or to take all these secret precautions to get rid of
me. You need only have told me the truth. [<i>On
the terrace at back a servant girl appears. She is
carrying <span class="smcap">Juhasz’s</span> overcoat and bag. He sees her
and turns to <span class="smcap">Philip</span>.</i>] Come, Philip. [<i>His voice
is low and trembling with sorrow and humiliation.</i>]
Let us go. [<i>They start up toward the door.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—Mr. Juhasz ... won’t you forgive me
... and shake hands ... before you go?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Going; does not look at her.</i>] Good-bye,
Miss Paula.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—Have you forgotten all you said to me?
You are leaving me alone ... alone with him.
[<i><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span> stops, turns to her slowly. Seeing this,
she gathers courage.</i>] You are leaving me like
this because your pride is hurt. You don’t care
any more ... what becomes of me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Opens his mouth, closes it again,
wavers, then suddenly roars at <span class="smcap">Philip</span>, who has been
looking on in blank amazement.</i>] Why do you stand
there like a blockhead? Why don’t you take me
away from here? Can’t you see I am about to stay?
[<i><span class="smcap">Philip</span> takes his arm and leads him out at back:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
There is a pause. <span class="smcap">Paula</span> watches them go, then she
crosses slowly to the <span class="smcap">Count’s</span> desk. In the garden,
coming from the right, the <span class="smcap">Count</span> appears. He
stands in the doorway a moment, looking off left,
apparently watching <span class="smcap">Juhasz</span> and <span class="smcap">Philip</span> depart.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—Can I believe my eyes? Is that really
Juhasz going toward the station? [<i>She does not
reply. He comes in. On the threshold he glances
again off left.</i>] If they hurry they can still catch
the 12.05. It just pulled in the station. [<i>Looks
off left once more; comes down.</i>] Well, sunbeam!
[<i><span class="smcap">Paula</span> looks at him sorrowfully then lowers her
eyes.</i>] We are alone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—Alone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—It is hard to realize he is really gone.
I shall go on expecting him to pop in that door
any moment, or appear at the window, or crawl
from under the table.... It doesn’t seem possible
that I’m free of him at last ... that we are free.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—[<i>Sadly.</i>] Free.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—But it’s true, little sunbeam, it’s true!
No more dictation. No more political speeches.
No more interruptions.... Now all that remains
to be done is have the car overhauled ... telegraph
to Vienna, Salzburg, Paris ... for the best rooms
in the best hotels ... for the most exquisite frocks
... for the most magnificent cabin on the swiftest
boat to the most beautiful seaport in Spain....<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
[<i>Comes toward her ardently. The whistle of the
departing train is heard. <span class="smcap">Paula</span> jumps up as if
someone had called her, and makes an involuntary
movement toward the door at back.</i>] His train.
[<i>Angrily.</i>] Is he to hinder me even now? It was
just as if he had called back to us. [<i><span class="smcap">Paula</span> goes
toward the door at right.</i>] Why, Paula! Where
are you going?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—[<i>Stops at the typewriting machine.</i>] To
my work.... Unless your excellency wishes to give
me dictation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—Dictation? Are you serious?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—But why?... Did anything happen ...
between you and Juhasz?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—[<i>Softly.</i>] Nothing happened. [<i>Starts
to go.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—[<i>In polite resignation.</i>] No ... no ...
wait ... I’ll dictate, if I must. [<i>She sits at the
machine. He repeats mechanically, distrustfully.</i>]
I’ll dictate, if I must. [<i>Eyes her narrowly.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—We stopped at “The deplorable policies
inaugurated by the Minister of Agriculture——”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—Deplorable policy ... yes. Well ...
if I must ... go ahead ... [<i>Sighs.</i>] “The very
deplorable policy ...”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—[<i>Writing.</i>] Policy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—“Inaugurated by the Minister ...
leaves the farmer bewildered and quite helpless.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—[<i>As she writes, bows her head lower over
the machine.</i>] Helpless.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—“Now the farmer is devoted to the minister
...” [<i>His quick expressive glance meets her
eye as she looks up.</i>] “... but the minister does
not love the farmer.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—[<i>Writing.</i>] Farmer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—“And can the farmer be blamed for feeling
abandoned and betrayed?”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—And betrayed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—“But I, for one, know that his excellency,
the minister of agriculture ... belongs to the
old school of honor ... to those who will not
abuse——”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—Abuse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—“The faith that was placed in them.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—“The farmer does not ask for sympathy.
He wishes no allegiance that is not conscientiously

the minister to——”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—[<i>Sorrowfully.</i>] He mustn’t believe that,
your excellency.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Count</span>—Go on writing, Paula, that belongs in
the speech.... And you may add that I too think
that it is a forlorn hope, a mistaken belief, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
the farmer must teach himself to renounce. [<i><span class="smcap">Paula</span>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—[<i>Rises.</i>] I beg pardon, your excellency....

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Scene</span>—<i>The shop again. It is a sunny autumn
morning. When the curtain rises <span class="smcap">Juhasz</span> is
escorting the Insignificant Lady to the door,
which <span class="smcap">Philip</span> holds open for her.</i></p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Unassuming Lady</span>—[<i>As she goes.</i>] Thank
you. I will telephone you on Wednesday about
noon, and if the materials have arrived I will come
in during the afternoon some time. Good day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Good day, madame.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—Good day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Unassuming Lady</span>—[<i>To <span class="smcap">Philip</span>.</i>] Good day.
[<i>She exits. <span class="smcap">Philip</span> closes the door. <span class="smcap">Juhasz</span> returns
to the counter down right and begins clearing
away.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Gloomily.</i>] This place gets more like
a graveyard every day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—I don’t see how you can say that, Mr.
Juhasz. You’ve only been back two weeks, and in
those two weeks you have done more business than
you used to do in two months.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Morosely.</i>] Not enough to suit me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—It has become the fashion to buy here.
Everybody in Budapest seems anxious to help you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Because they are sorry for me. I don’t
want them to be sorry for me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—Nonsense! It’s because they like you.
You ought to be very happy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—I’m not happy. Do you understand?
And I won’t be happy until I have paid him back
every heller he laid out for me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—At this rate it won’t take long.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—I haven’t slept in two weeks, and I
shan’t sleep while I remain under obligation to him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—I really don’t see why you are so angry
with the Count. After all, he did it for your good.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—He did it for his own good. And now
he laughs at me ... he and ... Paula.... [<i>The
door opens. <span class="smcap">Oscar</span> stands irresolutely on the
threshold. He is shabby and crestfallen.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—Good morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Good morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—Good morning, Philip.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—How do you do? [<i>Turns his back on
<span class="smcap">Oscar</span> and, with ostentatious delicacy, exits through
the archway. There is a pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—He’s angry with me. [<i>A pause.</i>] I
hope ... you are not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—No. [<i>He continues to clear away.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—I hope you don’t mind my coming here.
I have several reasons for coming. First, I consider
it my duty....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Please! You have no more duties where
I am concerned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—Oh, but I have!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Yes, I know. You can’t pay me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—Not at present. Unfortunately!...
In the second place, I owe Philip three kronen ...
[<i>fumbles in his pocket</i>] that I want to pay him....
In the third place, knowing what a kind heart
you have——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Impatiently.</i>] Say what you have to
say, and make it short. I am busy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—[<i>With an ironic glance around the empty
shop.</i>] One would never think it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Well, if it interests you, business is fine.
I’ve done more in the past two weeks than I used
to do in two months. Yes!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—Really? Really? I am very glad to
hear it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Impatiently.</i>] Well? Say what you
have to say, and get it over with.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—Why, er ... to be brief ... I want a job.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Where?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—Here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—With me? You want a job here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Almost speechless with astonishment.</i>]
Well!... My dear man.... [<i>He comes around to
the front of the counter, trying vainly to find words
to express his feelings.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—If you knew how poor we are——</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—So ... so ... you take me for an utter
idiot!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—Please don’t say that ... please!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—You must. To ask me that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—I’ve been everywhere. I’ve been at Laszlo
and Barna’s, at Chellis’s, at Semlinger and Weiss’s,
at Stein’s, at Brunner’s, at Kramer’s, at Gold’s, at
Reedo’s, at Kelamen’s ... every shop in town ...
and they all know that I am the most competent
man in the business ... but they all gave me the
cold shoulder ... [<i>points accusingly at <span class="smcap">Juhasz</span></i>]
... on your account!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—On my account? That’s very likely!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—It’s true. They all say they won’t have
an employe who could abuse the confidence of a man
like you. Yes ... you can stare ... but it’s true.
You are keeping me out of a job.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—<i>I</i> am?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—If you were a plain, ordinary man ...
like everyone else, nobody would care what had
happened between us....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Now, really, this is——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—I am practically boycotted, that’s what
I am! Can I help it if you are a saint? Wouldn’t
I have fallen in love with your wife just the same
if you had been a scoundrel? Why should I be held
answerable for your virtues?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—No, that’s not fair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—I acted honestly and fairly toward you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Let us say you did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—And certainly Adele did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—That’s true.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—And <i>now</i> look at me.... I had no supper
last night, if you want to know it.... Neither I nor
your wife.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—When you can’t buy her supper, then
she’s <i>my</i> wife, eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—Go on and joke about it.... But we
went to bed without supper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—But then ... she was <i>your</i> wife.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—Your jokes don’t alter the facts. You
are responsible for this.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—For what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—For the fact that we are starving. For
the fact that I am shabby. And for ... [<i>raises
his trousers leg</i>] the fact that my socks are in holes....
And for the boycott against me.... But if
you don’t care whether your former wife starves or
not—— [<i><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span> reaches for his purse. <span class="smcap">Oscar</span> puts
out a firm, protesting hand.</i>] No, my friend, no!
[<i>Heroically.</i>] We don’t accept alms.... Believe
me, you’d be the last I’d come to for a job if I
had only myself to consider. You can imagine
what I went through before I brought myself to the
point of crossing your threshold. And now if, after
all, <i>you</i> send me away too——</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Touched, but refitting his impulse.</i>]
Will it always be like this?... Why can’t they let
me be? [<i>Turns, comes down right, passes behind the
counter. <span class="smcap">Philip</span> enters through the archway.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—[<i>Follows <span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>.</i>] Well ... what do
you say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Through his clenched teeth.</i>] I can’t....
You mustn’t ask it of me. I’ll do anything but
that.... My dear fellow, you must see I can’t do
that....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—[<i>Bends over the counter toward him.</i>]
Then, at least, will you give me six pair of black
socks? [<i>Raises his trousers leg.</i>] Mine are in tatters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—You won’t even do that for me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Impatiently.</i>] Certainly I will....
[<i>Takes a box from the shelves, throws it on the
counter.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—You are not going to offer me those HBs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—What kind do you want then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—You might at least give me KMs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—I have no more KMs. They are all
gone. [<i>Puts out another box.</i>] Here are some
AWs. [<i>Opens the box.</i>] They are very good.
[<i>Shows him a pair.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—Are you trying to tell <i>me</i> these are good?
[<i>Fingers them.</i>] Cobweb?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Not at all. [<i>He feels them too.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—[<i>Feels them again.</i>] Why, if I put these
flimsy things on now they’d be in holes before I got
home.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—They don’t knit socks of steel wire, you
know. [<i>The <span class="smcap">Thorough Young Lady</span> enters.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thorough Young Lady</span>—Good morning.
[<i><span class="smcap">Philip</span>, <span class="smcap">Juhasz</span> and <span class="smcap">Oscar</span> return her greeting
simultaneously. <span class="smcap">Oscar</span>, socks in hand, even bows
and smiles to her. She addresses <span class="smcap">Oscar</span>.</i>] I’d like
a dozen very fine men’s handkerchiefs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—[<i>Sadly, pointing to <span class="smcap">Philip</span>.</i>] There,
please.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thorough Young Lady</span>—Yes. [<i>She goes to
<span class="smcap">Philip</span> at the back counter.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—It’s enough to break your heart. [<i>He
looks back at them enviously, dangling the socks
from his hand.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thorough Young Lady</span>—[<i>To <span class="smcap">Philip</span>.</i>] Now I
don’t want the kind that fade when they are washed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—All our handkerchiefs are absolutely
fast colors, madame. [<i>Puts out a box full.</i>] Won’t
you sit down?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thorough Young Lady</span>—Thanks. [<i>She sits
and examines the handkerchiefs.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—These are batiste, madame, and these
are French linen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thorough Young Lady</span>—Haven’t you got these
in a bigger size?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—Yes, ma’am. [<i>Puts out another box.</i>]
These are bigger.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thorough Young Lady</span>—Are these the very
largest?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—[<i>Indicating others in the same box.</i>]
Those are larger.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thorough Young Lady</span>—Are these the largest
you carry?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—There is no larger handkerchief made,
ma’am. [<i>He opens an enormous handkerchief.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Impatiently.</i>] Do you want these
socks or not?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—It’s enough to break your heart! Why
doesn’t he show her the Rumbergers?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—He knows what he’s doing. [<i>Impatiently.</i>]
Please don’t take up any more of my
time. You can have these if you want them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—These shoddy things!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—I can’t be bothered with you any longer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—You can’t palm them off on any customer,
yet you expect me to take them. Why, they
are the worst quality in the shop! [<i>The <span class="smcap">Dissatisfied
Lady</span> enters.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Good morning. [<i>Leaving <span class="smcap">Oscar</span>, he
goes to the back counter.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dissatisfied Lady</span>—[<i>Joins <span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>.</i>] Good<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
morning, Mr. Juhasz. I want to look at some nice
neckties. To-morrow is my husband’s birthday, and
I want to get him some for a surprise.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Will you step this way, please?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dissatisfied Lady</span>—He told me exactly the kind
he wanted, and said I could go as high as a hundred
kronen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—I see. A real surprise.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dissatisfied Lady</span>—Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thorough Young Lady</span>—No, no, no ... not
lilac.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Instead of buying ready-made ones,
why not select your patterns and have them made
up?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—This is the newest color, Jerusalem blue.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dissatisfied Lady</span>—You are sure you could get
them out for me in time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Oh, yes. That would give you the
choice of some very nice silks in restricted patterns.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thorough Young Lady</span>—This straw color is
very attractive.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dissatisfied Lady</span>—I might look at them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—We never cut more than one tie of each
pattern. Would you step in here? [<i>He indicates
the archway. The <span class="smcap">Nervous Gentleman</span> enters.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—Good day, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nervous Gentleman</span>—Good day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>To the <span class="smcap">Nervous Gentleman</span>.</i>] Good
day. Just a moment, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—[<i>To the <span class="smcap">Thorough Young Lady</span>.</i>]
These are Rumbergers. A very well-known brand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Flashes <span class="smcap">Oscar</span> a look of triumph.</i>]
After you, madame. [<i>Follows the <span class="smcap">Dissatisfied Lady</span>
off through the archway.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—Will you have a seat, sir? I’ll be with
you in just a moment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nervous Gentleman</span>—Thank you. [<i>He remains
standing at the counter, right.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—Pastel green, pastel brown, pastel blue,
pastel yellow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thorough Young Lady</span>—I don’t know what
pastel is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—Pastel is four kronen fifty, madame.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thorough Young Lady</span>—You haven’t got something
about half pastel, have you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—Yes, we have. [<i>Puts out still another
box. To the <span class="smcap">Nervous Gentleman</span>.</i>] Won’t you sit
down, sir? Mr. Juhasz will be there in a moment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nervous Gentleman</span>—That’s all right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—These are lighter ... two kronen apiece
lighter. [<i>The <span class="smcap">Nervous Gentleman</span> comes down to
the end of the counter where <span class="smcap">Oscar</span> stands disconsolately
before the open box of socks, one pair still
held in his hand.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thorough Young Lady</span>—And what about these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
darker shades? [<i>The <span class="smcap">Nervous Gentleman</span> pokes in
the box of socks.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—They are one krone fifty darker.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thorough Young Lady</span>—I’d like something between
the two.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—[<i>Pulls down another box.</i>] Between
the two.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—[<i>Deferentially.</i>] Those are socks, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nervous Gentleman</span>—I see they are.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—[<i>Very deferentially.</i>] Would you like
to look at some, sir?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nervous Gentleman</span>—Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—[<i>Shows the pair he is holding in his
hand.</i>] Black. Fil d’Ecosse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thorough Young Lady</span>—I’m afraid they are
too expensive. Let me look at the first ones again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nervous Gentleman</span>—[<i>Looks at his watch.</i>]
I’m afraid I can’t wait.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—One moment more, sir. Mr. Juhasz will
be right in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nervous Gentleman</span>—I know what your moments
mean. [<i>Picks up a sock.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—[<i>Ingratiatingly.</i>] Mr. Juhasz will be
right in, sir. Now here is an exceptionally fine
stocking, sir. [<i>Shows him the pair he has been
holding.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nervous Gentleman</span>—[<i>Compares it with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
one he is holding.</i>] Just the same as this, isn’t it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—Just the same. Genuine Fil d’Ecosse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nervous Gentleman</span>—Is it really good?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—Absolutely. [<i>He is at the end of the
counter now.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nervous Gentleman</span>—It looks good.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—You wouldn’t want a better sock, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—[<i>Who has been watching them; angrily.</i>]
Coming right away, sir. One second more!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nervous Gentleman</span>—[<i>Looks at him, then at
<span class="smcap">Oscar</span>.</i>] You ... work here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—Well ... not exactly, sir.... I ...
I ... I’m a relation of Mr. Juhasz’s.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nervous Gentleman</span>—Because I can’t wait any
longer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—[<i>Goes swiftly behind the counter.</i>] Then
just let me wait on you, sir ... until Mr. Juhasz
comes. This is a fine quality, sir, absolutely first
class.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nervous Gentleman</span>—Will these tear easily?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—[<i>Laughs.</i>] These? These are the strongest
Fil d’Ecosse made. [<i>Pulls at the hose.</i>] They’re
like steel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nervous Gentleman</span>—They look good.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—And they will feel good on the foot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nervous Gentleman</span>—I want a good quality.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—[<i>Spluttering in his eagerness.</i>] We sell
nothing but first-class goods, sir. You won’t find<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
a more durable Fil d’Ecosse anywhere. My ...
my brother-in-law imports it direct from England.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nervous Gentleman</span>—I’ll take some. Then I
want some with colored clocks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—How many of these, sir?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nervous Gentleman</span>—Well, if they are really
so good, give me a dozen pair.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—Yes, sir. Twelve. [<i>Counts them briskly.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thorough Young Lady</span>—Do you mind letting
me look at those first ones again? [<i>The <span class="smcap">Dissatisfied
Lady</span> and <span class="smcap">Juhasz</span> re-enter.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dissatisfied Lady</span>—[<i>Speaking as she enters.</i>]
... and my husband is very fond of bow ties, those
gay ones they are wearing now. [<i>Comes down left.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Without noticing <span class="smcap">Oscar</span>, he comes
down to the table at left.</i>] The bow ties are here,
madame. Considered very smart just now. Restricted
pattern, too. We only make up two or
three of each. A man doesn’t like to see the tie
he is wearing ... [<i>Now he sees <span class="smcap">Oscar</span>, who has just
climbed up on a stool to reach some boxes on the
top shelves. They look into each other’s eyes
across the shop. <span class="smcap">Juhasz’s</span> mouth remains open, the
word sticks in his throat, his hand, holding a necktie,
remains poised in the air.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—[<i>Quickly.</i>] The gentleman couldn’t
wait. He was about to walk out. I didn’t want to
see a customer walk out of the shop, so I just showed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
him one or two things in a hurry.... I’d like to
know about what size. Will you show me your
hand, please? [<i>The <span class="smcap">Nervous Gentleman</span> extends
his hand. <span class="smcap">Oscar</span>, looks at <span class="smcap">Juhasz</span> again, greatly
flustered, takes the <span class="smcap">Nervous Gentleman’s</span> hand,
shakes it cordially.</i>] How do you do? [<i>He stares
at <span class="smcap">Juhasz</span> anxiously.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nervous Gentleman</span>—What do you say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—Oh, pardon me! ... Will you close your
hand, sir? [<i>The <span class="smcap">Nervous Gentleman</span> extends
his fist. <span class="smcap">Oscar</span> measures a sock over it.</i>] These
are just right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thorough Young Lady</span>—[<i>To <span class="smcap">Philip</span>.</i>] Let me
see? Will they wear?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>To the <span class="smcap">Dissatisfied Lady</span>.</i>] A man
doesn’t like to see the same tie he is wearing on
somebody else. [<i>He is still staring at <span class="smcap">Oscar</span>.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—[<i>Rapidly.</i>] Three pair.... Yes, sir.
And a dozen of these ... and now—— [<i>Scans the
shelves.</i>] Long black Fil d’Ecosse with clocks.
[<i>Takes down a box and throws it on the counter.</i>]
These are really excellent. [<i>Opens the box in feverish
haste, shows the socks.</i>] We are the only
ones in the city who carry them.... You can do
almost anything to this stocking without harming
it ... boil it, bake it, soak it in lye, in alcohol, in
vitriol.... May I see your hand again?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dissatisfied Lady</span>—[<i>Who has been rummaging<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
in the box, now has several neckties in her hand.</i>]
These aren’t bad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nervous Gentleman</span>—[<i>Extends his fist.</i>] It’s
socks I want, you know, not gloves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—Ha, ha, ha! That’s good! [<i>Measures.</i>]
These are exactly right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nervous Gentleman</span>—Sure they won’t be too
small?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—Perhaps just a half size larger. [<i>Turns
to the shelves again.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—The color won’t run if they are washed
in lukewarm water.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thorough Young Lady</span>—Are you quite sure?
[<i>The <span class="smcap">Nervous Gentleman</span> takes the socks from
<span class="smcap">Oscar</span> and inspects them.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dissatisfied Lady</span>—These aren’t exactly what I
wanted either, but I’ll take them. How much does
it all come to?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Still watching <span class="smcap">Oscar</span>. His voice
trembles.</i>] Seven kronen.... And these are five-fifty
... these long ones ... nine kronen eleven.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thorough Young Lady</span>—What did you say
these were?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dissatisfied Lady</span>—I’m sure my husband won’t
like them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thorough Young Lady</span>—[<i>Rises.</i>] Yes, perhaps
I had better look at them too.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nervous Gentleman</span>—And now I want a couple
of pair with some sort of design, not clocks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—Stars, circles, dots, triangles, squares,
circles, stars, squares, dots——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nervous Gentleman</span>—Some very quiet design.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—[<i>Contemplates the shelves.</i>] Quiet, quiet
... Just a moment, sir. I’ll bring it right here.
[<i>He hurries off through the archway.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dissatisfied Lady</span>—These are rather good. But
I only see one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—There must be more. [<i>He rummages
in the box.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thorough Young Lady</span>—Now, if you don’t
mind, we will go over the lot from the beginning.
Seeing so many kinds gets one all confused.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—Just as you say, madame.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—[<i>Re-enters with a box.</i>] How do you
like these, sir? [<i>Puts it on the counter.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nervous Gentleman</span>—Too loud. Much too
loud. I want something very quiet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—[<i>Greatly perturbed.</i>] If I only knew
where they were. [<i>In perplexity.</i>] Quiet, quiet,
quiet ... [<i>Looks at <span class="smcap">Philip</span>.</i>] If I only knew where
those ... [<i>As <span class="smcap">Philip</span> ignores him, he raises his
voice.</i>] They used to be kept here on the third
shelf.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Grudgingly, angrily.</i>] Fourth shelf<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
... on the end. [<i><span class="smcap">Philip</span> angrily bangs a box down
on the counter.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—My God! [<i>Startled, puts his hand over
his heart.</i>] Thank you, thank you, sir! ... On
the end ... [<i>Transported with joy.</i>] Very kind of
you, sir! [<i>He is almost weeping.</i>] Fourth shelf
... on the end. Thank you, sir!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dissatisfied Lady</span>—[<i>Who has by this time accumulated
a handful of neckties.</i>] That will be all.
... Just these ten.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Going to the cashier’s desk.</i>] We will
send them this afternoon, madame.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dissatisfied Lady</span>—How much do I owe?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Five times seven ... and five times five
fifty.... Sixty-two fifty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dissatisfied Lady</span>—[<i>Gives him a hundred krone
note.</i>] If you please.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Has gone behind the cashier’s desk.</i>]
Sixty-two fifty. [<i>Rings the cash register, makes
change.</i>] And fifty are sixty-three, ninety, one
hundred. Thank you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dissatisfied Lady</span>—This afternoon without fail.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—[<i>Raises his head.</i>] 16 Nador Street,
Fourth Floor, Apartment 1.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dissatisfied Lady</span>—That’s right. Good day.
[<i>She exits. <span class="smcap">Juhasz</span> escorts her to the door, closes
it after her, turns, glares at <span class="smcap">Oscar</span> and comes toward
him slowly.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—[<i>Watches him come, fearfully, as if he

stars, these with the white squares, and would you
like these violet dots, and these with the very dainty
circles, and these....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nervous Gentleman</span>—Hold on. I only want
three. Let me see. [<i>He examines the socks.
<span class="smcap">Juhasz</span> passes them slowly, and goes to the <span class="smcap">Thorough
Young Lady</span> whom <span class="smcap">Philip</span> is showing a bath-robe.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thorough Young Lady</span>—It looks like a night-gown.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nervous Gentleman</span>—Put these three aside.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Who is standing now between the two
counters.</i>] Show the lady those hooded robes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nervous Gentleman</span>—[<i>Rises.</i>] And now
quickly, for I am late, a white cap, please.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—[<i>Looks at <span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>.</i>] A white cap.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Looks at <span class="smcap">Oscar</span> sternly.</i>] <i>I’ll</i> get it
for the gentleman. [<i>He exits through the archway.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—[<i>Crestfallen.</i>] The chief will bring it
right in, sir. [<i>There is a pause. <span class="smcap">Oscar</span> rubs his
hands.</i>] We have some very nice neckwear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nervous Gentleman</span>—I don’t need any, thanks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—Tennis shoes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nervous Gentleman</span>—Thank you, no.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—[<i>With a furtive glance at <span class="smcap">Philip</span>.</i>]
Bathrobes? [<i>The <span class="smcap">Nervous Gentleman</span> shakes
his head.</i>] White gaiters?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nervous Gentleman</span>—[<i>Sharply.</i>] Thank you,
no! [<i>Rises.</i>] I asked for a white cap. [<i>A brief
pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—Nice walking stick?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nervous Gentleman</span>—[<i>Crossly.</i>] No ... A
cap is what I asked for.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—[<i>Offended.</i>] It will be here right away.
[<i>Crosses to the table down left, takes a stick from
the rack which stands there, flourishes it.</i>] This
is a very unusual stick, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nervous Gentleman</span>—I said I didn’t want one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—Yes, sir. [<i>He flourishes the stick, demonstrating
its lightness. The <span class="smcap">Nervous Gentleman</span>

I don’t need it. [<i>Returns it to <span class="smcap">Oscar</span>.</i>] I have

is, he’s at Monte Carlo just now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Monte Carlo. Great railway junction.
Gambling casinos.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—No. He has gone there to shoot pigeons.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—He never used to like that kind of sport.</p>

Ever since you went away. When he hears that
there is to be a slaughter of pigeons somewhere he
rushes to the spot.... I was supposed to have gone
to Monte Carlo with him, but I didn’t.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—You didn’t go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—Six will be plenty until I get to Paris.
I can buy more there if I need them. You can get
everything in Paris.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Yes.... You can get everything in
Paris.... A wonderful city.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—But so far to motor to.... I’m afraid

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—You won’t be bored.... You probably

a footman’s cap made up for me quickly?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Footman?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—I’ve been so annoyed about his cap. The
one he brought with him was all covered with gold
braid. He looked just like a hotel doorman. What
I wish you’d get for me is something discreet and
in good taste, something suitable for a private dwelling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—A private dwelling....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—Yes. For a lady living alone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Tremblingly writes.</i>] Footman ...
cap ... private dwelling.... I’ll look around at
the cap-maker’s.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—I shall be awfully obliged. [<i>She rises.
There is a pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Rises.</i>] Not at all. It’s I who am
obliged.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—[<i>Meets his eyes steadily.</i>] Why do you

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Looks down at his list.</i>] I’m pleased
to see how clever you have been.... Butler, motor
car, private dwelling, white gloves. I didn’t
know....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—You didn’t know?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—But ... the whole city knows——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Let us not talk about that, Paula. The
important thing is that you are happy. Is his excellency
well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—[<i>Nervously.</i>] He is a perfect gentleman.
One must say that for him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Certainly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—After he had gone to the trouble and expense
of buying and furnishing a whole house for
me.... You probably know the place ... that
little mansion in Biedermeyer style that belonged to
the late Count Schattenheim....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Yes....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—He bought it for me and furnished it
beautifully and then he had the tact to go off to
Monte Carlo. And when he got there he sent me a
thousand-word telegram.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—A thousand. That’s a lot of words.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—A telegram to the effect that he had gone

destiny, he said.... The mansion was mine ...<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
on the day that ... of my own free will ... I
entered it. On the desk in my boudoir ... he said
... I would find a telegram already written and
addressed. It consists of a single word, “Come.”
... Twenty-eight hours after I send that telegram
he will knock on my door.... So far ... that is
all that’s happened.... Tactful of him, wasn’t it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Very.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—That was ten days ago.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Yes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—[<i>More and more nervously.</i>] I haven’t
sent the telegram yet. [<i>There is a pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>More and more calmly.</i>] I can imagine
how eagerly he must be awaiting it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—He said he would wait fourteen days. I
have four days left....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—From what you ordered here, I observe——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—[<i>Sharply.</i>] I haven’t sent the telegram
yet. [<i>A pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—One needs time for everything.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—I have four days left. [<i>Nervously.</i>]
And as the last day draws nearer ... I have been
wondering ... because you have always been so
good to me ... what <i>you</i> would think about it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—I should consider it very clever of you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—Are you advising me to do it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—I am reconciling myself to the idea.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—You see how....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—I see how clever you are. And how
happy you will be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—[<i>Sharply.</i>] I’ll send it off ... this
afternoon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Then the Count ought to receive it to-night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—Yes.</p>

be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—Yes. He loves me ... very much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Yes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—You used to have a certain French perfume.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—It seems to me it was called “Exquisite
heur.” A very strong, sensuous perfume. A perfume
for bad women.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—At least you said only bad women would
use it, and even they ... only for ... the most
intimate occasions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Wincing.</i>] Yes, I have some left.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—I’ll have a bottle, please.... Two bottles....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—You are a bit cruel, Paula. You might
at least have bought <i>that</i> somewhere else.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—I’d rather buy it here.</p>

[<i>Sharply.</i>] That perfume for harlots! [<i>To the

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patient Lady</span>—I’d like to look at some scarfs,
Mr. Juhasz. And a nice sweater.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—Mr. Oscar! You here again?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—I’m here, but I’m not Mr. Oscar any

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—[<i>Shakes her head.</i>] What are you doing
here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—[<i>Cheerfully.</i>] My affairs didn’t go so
well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—Where is Mrs.——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—She’s <i>my</i> wife now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—And Mr. Juhasz took you back? You
must have begged him on your knees.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—That wouldn’t have done any good. You
have to know how to handle him. There were a
lot of customers here, and I started right in waiting
on one. Pure psychology! I know Mr. Juhasz
backwards.... He hasn’t got the heart to throw
anybody out.... Is there anything else I can get
you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—No, thank you. [<i>The <span class="smcap">Old Gentleman</span>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Gentleman</span>—I want a pair of inexpensive
gloves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—Inexpensive. Yes, sir. What kind?
Won’t you sit down?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Gentleman</span>—Swedish. Size nine and a half.
Dark gray. [<i>Sits at about the middle of the right

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—[<i>Lays out a box.</i>] Dark gray. Swedish.

time. [<i>To the <span class="smcap">Old Gentleman</span>.</i>] How do you like
these? [<i>Opens and expands a pair.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Gentleman</span>—Are they Swedish?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—Why, old Heinrich Ibsen himself wasn’t
as Swedish as these gloves are.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Gentleman</span>—Ibsen was a Norwegian.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—I said he wasn’t as Swedish! Ha, ha!

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—What about the motor?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—That was it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Fifty horse-power.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—Only one horse-power.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Goes to the cashier’s desk.</i>] Then ...
the motor is in the garage?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—In the moon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—Far off.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Shall I telephone now about the footman’s
cap?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—Don’t bother. The footman has his cap.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Has he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—But he hasn’t got a job.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—How’s that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—Because there is no mansion for him to
work in. While I sat over there ... [<i>points to the

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Gauntlets?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—Shan’t need any.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Twenty-four pair of white gloves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—That’s twenty-three too many. I do need
one pair.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—One pair?</p>

you need them.... Perfume.... Exquisite heur.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—No, indeed!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Yes. Three bottles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—I hate the stuff.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—I adore it. It’s the most beautiful scent
on earth. Four bottles!</p>

order a barrel. [<i>There is a brief pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—[<i>Jealously.</i>] And ... what about the

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—[<i>Rises slowly.</i>] I wonder how it is ...

How interesting! [<i>Goes to the cashier’s desk.</i>] My
husband is going to Wiesbaden. I hear your mother

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—Idle gossip, madame. [<i>Points to the
package.</i>] Are you paying for that now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aristocratic Lady</span>—No. Charge it, please. As
usual.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—[<i>Very curt and businesslike.</i>] Yes,
madame. But we must ask you not to charge any
more things here until your old account is settled.
[<i>The <span class="smcap">Aristocratic Lady</span> gasps.</i>] And about that
old account. We must have a check by the first of
the month or we shall be compelled to place it in
our attorney’s hands.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aristocratic Lady</span>—What’s that you say?
[<i><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span> makes a gesture of protest.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—In our attorney’s hands. From to-day
on we are inaugurating a new policy of extending
credits for a limited period only.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aristocratic Lady</span>—[<i>Furious.</i>] Mr. Juhasz,
what do you say to this?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—[<i>Before <span class="smcap">Juhasz</span> can answer.</i>] Mr.
Juhasz has nothing to say to it. He has given me
entire charge of the credit department. [<i><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>

<p><span class="smcap">Aristocratic Lady</span>—[<i>Indignantly.</i>] Good day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—That settles her. And there are a few

<p><span class="smcap">Juhasz</span>—Take a dozen pair of socks before
you go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span>—[<i>Jovially; taps his pocket.</i>] I have.</p>

this with my compliments.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thorough Young Lady</span>—I knew I’d forget something....
I forgot to tell you that I don’t want a
period after each initial of the monograms on those
handkerchiefs.... Just the letters without the
periods.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—[<i>Graciously.</i>] Certainly, madame. We
never have periods embroidered unless they are specially
ordered.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span>—[<i>Who has gone behind his counter.</i>] I’ll
make a note of it, madame, to be quite sure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—Is there anything else you would like
to-day? [<i>Comes around to the table.</i>] Are you interested
in these girdles with antique silver buckles?
They are just in from Paris. [<i>She holds one up.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thorough Young Lady</span>—May I see?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—There are only a few, as you see, and they
are selling very fast. So if you’d like one——</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thorough Young Lady</span>—I couldn’t possibly afford
one this month.</p>

madame. Why, you can pay——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paula</span>—[<i>Catches him up quickly, with unmistakable
emphasis.</i>] For something cheaper, perhaps.
Unfortunately we can’t charge these girdles because
we had to pay cash for them ourselves. They are
not ordinary merchandise, you see. They are made
by a new atelier in Paris which—— [<i>As she speaks,

<h4>ACT ONE</h4>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Scene</span>—<i>A pavilion in the garden which serves as a
classroom for the young princes. At left an
open door through which the garden can be
seen, brilliant with sunlight. At right a glass
door which leads into the other rooms. It is
a summer afternoon. When the curtain rises
<span class="smcap">Dr. Agi</span> is lecturing to <span class="smcap">Georg</span> and <span class="smcap">Arsen</span> at
a table. The boys are listening attentively.</i></p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>— ... After a series of humiliations and protracted
physical sufferings he died on the island of
St. Helena, on the fifth day of May, 1821, at the
age of fifty-two. He was buried on a promontory
of the island on which, in his lifetime, he had loved
to sit and contemplate the sea. His faithful attendants
wished to inscribe the word “<span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>” on
his grave-stone.... But his tormentor, Hudson
Lowe, persecuting him even beyond the grave, forbade
it. The contemptible Hudson Lowe permitted
them to inscribe only the words, “<span class="smcap">Le General
Buonaparte</span>.” Later the body was conveyed to
France in solemn state; and Paris honored the
martyred emperor with magnificent funeral services.
There, to this day, in the Dom des Invalides,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
raised high on a majestically simple bier of stone,
he lies at rest. [<i>He has concluded the lecture. The
boys are silent, impressed. <span class="smcap">Agi</span> looks at his watch.</i>]
That finishes our lesson for to-day. [<i>Closes the
book.</i>] Have your highnesses any questions to
ask?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arsen</span>—Last night we had a dispute with mother.
She hates Napoleon. She said he was a usurper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—That’s one point of view.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georg</span>—How do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Your highnesses are free to form your own
opinions. For my part, I consider him a genius
who made his power felt throughout the world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georg</span>—Is that your point of view?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georg</span>—Then it’s mine too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arsen</span>—That’s what I call an independent
opinion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georg</span>—So it is.... Not mine, but the professor’s.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arsen</span>—Mother was very angry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—With Napoleon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georg</span>—And with you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—What for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georg</span>—For not teaching us to hate Napoleon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—I present his story without bias of any sort.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arsen</span>—We told mother that, but she thinks you
ought to teach us to hate him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georg</span>—She says Napoleon is largely to blame
for the dethronement of our family.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—With all deference to her royal highness,
that is a somewhat exaggerated view of the historical
facts. Napoleon himself never altered in the
political status of your illustrious family. If anyone
can be blamed for it, it was the King of Württemberg.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georg</span>—But the King of Württemberg was one
of Napoleon’s puppets.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Well, indirectly, there may be something
in it. That is why I used the term exaggerated.
And yet, if anyone can profit by a study of the
courage, the initiative and the luck of Napoleon,
certainly, in my opinion, a dethroned sovereign family
can. Doesn’t his career teach us that thrones
are not unattainable? He was only an obscure
attorney’s son. Now what he could attain, surely
someone, who by right of birth——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arsen</span>—Mother——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georg</span>—Mother is sensitive on the subject of
thrones just now, because Prince Albert is staying
with us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arsen</span>—Mother has always been sensitive about
thrones.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georg</span>—Prince Albert is heir-apparent to a real
throne. And when mother lays eyes on an heir-apparent,
she loses her appetite.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arsen</span>—Poor mother! No wonder. Her great-grandmother
was a ruling sovereign. Mother can’t
be reconciled to the fact that that glory’s forever
ended.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georg</span>—Forever?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Yes ... probably.... Nowadays it is
very difficult to——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arsen</span>—But suppose the Heir-Apparent marries
Alexandra.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georg</span>—He won’t marry her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arsen</span>—How do you know he won’t? If he does
marry her, Alexandra will be queen some day and we,
as her family, will be attached to the Court. And
if I know my mother, it won’t be Albert who’ll
do the ruling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georg</span>—<i>If</i> he marries her!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arsen</span>—He’ll marry her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georg</span>—Why should he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arsen</span>—Because mother wants him to. And because
we all want him to,—Aunt Symphorosa, Alexandra
herself, I, you, the professor——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georg</span>—I don’t want him to marry her. Do you,
professor?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Indeed ... there is no station so exalted
that her highness, the Princess Alexandra would not
grace it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georg</span>—Just the same, you don’t want her to
marry him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—I? Why do you say that?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georg</span>—Because you spoke so coldly and formally.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—I ... I was surprised ... that’s all. It
isn’t easy to grasp ... so suddenly. You see,
during the few months in which I have been attached
to your illustrious family—if I may put it so—her
highness, your sister ... great lady though
she is ... has been very kind to me ... to us all.
Among other things, it has been my privilege to
instruct her in fencing ... and when I am suddenly
called upon to think that my pupil is to wear the
ermine ... that she is to wear a crown ... and
sit upon a throne.... Well ... that’s not an
easy thing to——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georg</span>—I’d be sorry to leave this place ... it’s
so pleasant here. The Hungarians have been so
good to us. But, if we had to leave, you’d come
with us, wouldn’t you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—If I were wanted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arsen</span>—I shouldn’t mind going. Life at Court
might be tiresome; but politics, they say, are exciting.
Keep you either trembling all the time ... or
laughing. [<i><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span> and <span class="smcap">Alexandra</span> enter from
the garden. All rise.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Finished your lesson, I see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Yes, your highness. [<i><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span> stands
silent and motionless down left.</i>] We reached the
death of Napoleon about ten minutes ago; and it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
seemed to me such an appropriate stopping place I
didn’t think it worth while to start a new chapter
to-day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—[<i>Sharply.</i>] An appropriate stopping
place?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—So I thought, your highness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—A stopping place for the dead man,
yes. But for us ... merely a comma in an unfinished
sentence.... Arsen! Georg! Prince Albert is
coming to visit you here. He has expressed the
wish to talk with you about your studies. I infer
from what he said that he is particularly interested
in history. Count Luetzen, whom I consulted later,
has confirmed that inference. Now go wash your
hands and faces, comb your hair, and change your
clothes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arsen</span>—When is he coming?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—As soon as he awakes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georg</span>—Is he asleep?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—I said, “As soon as he awakes.” Which
should have conveyed to you the information that
he is now asleep.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georg</span>—It did, mother. That’s why I asked you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—That remark is superfluous. Arsen,
I hear you have been coughing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arsen</span>—No, mother; only once or twice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Symphorosa tells me you have been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
coughing. [<i>To <span class="smcap">Agi</span>.</i>] Why haven’t you reported
it to me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—This morning his highness ate a green pepper
and, despite my advice, neglected to remove the
fibers. That is why he coughed. I didn’t consider
it serious enough to report to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—You couldn’t possibly have known
whether it was serious or not. You’re not a doctor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georg</span>—[<i>To <span class="smcap">Arsen</span>.</i>] That’s what he gets for
Napoleon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—What did you say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georg</span>—Nothing, mother; I only coughed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—And you, I hear, were riding like a
wild man this morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georg</span>—Did Symphorosa tell you that too?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Unmannerly boy! What I asked you
was, why have you been riding like a wild man?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georg</span>—The horse was wild.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—[<i>To <span class="smcap">Agi</span>.</i>] Why didn’t you report
to me that the horse was wild?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—The horse was tame before his highness got
in the saddle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—You couldn’t possibly have known
that. You are not the stable master.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georg</span>—Then he couldn’t have reported it either.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—You are not to speak unless you are
spoken to. Arsen will have his throat wrapped with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
wet towels to-night, and, beginning to-morrow, you
will ride no other horse than Pretty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georg</span>—Pretty? Oh, mother!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Silence! [<i>They are suddenly silent.</i>]
I have a surprise for you. You don’t deserve it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arsen</span>—What is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georg</span>—What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Guess.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arsen</span>—Alexandra is going to be a queen. [<i>Great
embarrassment. Silence. <span class="smcap">Alexandra</span> makes a startled
movement.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Ill-mannered boy! How <i>can</i> you say
such a thing? I forbid you even to think of such
things. See here! I hope it isn’t you who puts
such ideas into the boys’ heads.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Heaven forbid, your highness!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Where then did you get that idea?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georg</span>—Why, I told it to him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—And where did you get it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georg</span>—I thought of it myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georg</span>—Don’t be angry because I can see things
for myself, mother. I have eyes in my head.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—If his highness, Prince Albert, weren’t
coming here soon I’d punish you severely. But
don’t suppose that you’ll get off so easily. [<i>To
<span class="smcap">Agi</span>.</i>] And you might have reported to me that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
the boys occupy their minds with such things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georg</span>—He couldn’t possibly have known. He’s
not a member of the family.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—You Robespierre! Out of my sight!
[<i>Utter silence.</i>] Now I’ll tell you the surprise.
My brother Karl—that is—Father Hyacinth is
here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georg</span>—Uncle Karl!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arsen</span>—Oh, I’m so <i>glad</i>! [<i>Both are wild with
joy; <span class="smcap">Arsen</span> embraces <span class="smcap">Agi</span>.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Wild Indians!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—They’re very fond of him, mother.
I am glad he has come, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arsen</span>—Glad! Professor, Uncle Karl is the
nicest man in the world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georg</span>—He used to be a prince, and now he is
in Holy Orders. A monk. Wears a cowl and a
hood. And a scapulary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Those are mere externals. The essential
thing is that he has a heart of gold and a
brain of steel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georg</span>—So he has.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arsen</span>—He renounced the world to enter an educational
order.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Yes, your highness, I heard about it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georg</span>—But you never met him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—I have never had the honor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georg</span>—Well, you’ll have the honor soon....
Mother, you couldn’t possibly have brought us better
news. Not even if you had come to tell us that
Alexandra——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Georg!...</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—I shan’t forget to have you punished.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—[<i>Calling from the garden.</i>] Beatrice!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Ssh! Wasn’t that someone calling?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—[<i>From the garden.</i>] Beatrice!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Just as I thought! It’s Hyacinth
shrieking my name. His manners are appalling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arsen</span>—Uncle Hyacinth!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georg</span>—Hyacinth! Hyacinth! [<i>They are about
to rush out to meet him.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Stay where you are. [<i>Sudden
silence.</i>] Indians! I’ll meet him myself, else he’ll
go on shouting until he awakens Prince Albert.
[<i><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span> goes out into the garden.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>To <span class="smcap">Agi</span>.</i>] My mother forgot to
tell you that his highness, the Prince, will later
witness the fencing exercises.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—As your highness commands.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—The necessary orders have been
given at the gymnasium. First there is to be sword
practice between you and the boys, then they are
to have a bout with the foils.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—May I ask whether your highness is to
take part?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—No. [<i>There is a pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georg</span>—Why not?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>Coldly.</i>] Because his highness
particularly expresses his interest in <i>your</i> fencing.
Are your costumes in proper condition?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Yes, your highness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—How long will it take you and the
boys to change?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Ten minutes will be plenty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—I ask because the program has been
rigidly fixed. When his highness has finished in here,
he is to inspect my little rose garden, and from
there he goes to the fencing exercises. The inspection
of the garden will take, I estimate, about fifteen
minutes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—I deeply regret that your highness is not
to show your skill in fencing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—I had expected to take part. But
if I am to show him the garden there won’t be time
for me to change.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—May I take the liberty to ask whether
someone else mightn’t show his highness the rose
garden?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Why do you ask that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Then your highness could change your costume
and take part in the fencing instead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>Coldly.</i>] And why fencing instead?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—I only ... thought ... your highness fences
so well ... and gracefully ... and——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—And?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—And anyone can show him the garden.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Thank you. I am quite aware of
that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—I beg your pardon, your highness. It’s
the pride of the teacher that prompts me to speak.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—The program is not regulated to
suit your pride. And, in any case, I have no need
of your advice on the subject. [<i>Raises her chin a
bit imperiously.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—As your highness commands. [<i>There is a
brief pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georg</span>—May I say something?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georg</span>—The professor is right. [<i>He goes to the
door as voices are heard outside. <span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span> and
<span class="smcap">Beatrice</span> enter.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arsen</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Georg</span>—[<i>Rushing to greet <span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>.</i>]
Uncle Hyacinth! Hyacinth!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arsen</span>—Welcome!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georg</span>—How long are you going to stay?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Now, now, now, not so boisterously.
[<i>Draws back playfully.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Indians!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georg</span>—How long are you going to stay?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—I’ve scarcely arrived, and here you
are asking me when I depart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georg</span>—Because we want you to stay a long
time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—It’s a long time since I’ve seen you.
[<i>Embraces each in turn.</i>] Let me look at you.
Splendid color! [<i>Feels their arms.</i>] And muscle
too, eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georg</span>—How long are you going to stay?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Not long, I’m sorry to say. [<i>Approaches
<span class="smcap">Agi</span>, who bows low.</i>] And this is your
tutor, Mr. Agi, of whom I have heard so much.
[<i>Shakes hands with him.</i>] Beatrice writes me excellent
reports about you. I hear you are not only
a good teacher but also an accomplished athlete.
You row and fence....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arsen</span>—And ride.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—That’s splendid! And are you very
fond of him, boys?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georg</span>—[<i>Earnestly.</i>] Oh, yes, Uncle Hyacinth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Good! And you? Are you satisfied
with your pupils?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Entirely, your royal highness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—No, professor, not highness. Only
an humble servant of Christ.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—I beg your pardon, Father.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Oh, you mustn’t blush about it.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
Else I shall reproach myself for having mentioned
it. But then it’s so charming of a doctor of philosophy
to blush. I feel we’re good friends already.
[<i>Shakes his hand again.</i>] I congratulate you on
your method. Culture seasoned with athletics—that’s
the ideal curriculum.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Hyacinth is such a confirmed pedagogue,
the teacher interests him more than the
pupils.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Quite so, my dear. Some day, when
it’s raining hard and we have nothing better to do,
I’ll explain to you why, for the good of the child,
one should look first into the teacher’s head. Well,
boys, what have you learned to-day?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arsen</span>—We finished Napoleon to-day. [<i>Glances
at <span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>. There is an awkward pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Mother doesn’t care much for Napoleon,
eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georg</span>—Last night we had a dispute about——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Now, Georg, don’t begin that all
over again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Why not? Tell me. What was the
dispute about?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arsen</span>—Mother thinks people should be taught
to hate Napoleon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georg</span>—Especially our family.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—And what do you think?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—I presented the story of Napoleon without
bias of any sort.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—My dear fellow, then come with me
and let me introduce you to the Historical Congress
at London as one of the world’s wonders. There is
no neutral ground where Napoleon is concerned.
One either hates him or loves him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georg</span>—He loves him, but he won’t admit it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Why won’t he admit it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—I have tried to let their highnesses form
their own opinions about him. Nevertheless, I <i>have</i>
pointed out to them Napoleon’s initiative, his courage
... and his luck.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Quite right. If anyone can profit
by studying Napoleon’s career, the young people of
this family can.... My dear fellow, you’re blushing
again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georg</span>—Because a little while ago he said the
same thing, almost word for word.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Ah, well, that doesn’t prove it. But
if we are in error, my friend, at least there are two
of us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Time for you to get ready. [<i>To
<span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>.</i>] Prince Albert will be here to visit
them shortly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Then off with you. See you later,
professor. [<i><span class="smcap">Agi</span> bows and exits with the boys.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—No matter what you say, I insist that
the man was a usurper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—What man?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Mother never utters his name.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Sorry. I had forgotten. [<i><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>
enters from the garden.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—He is asleep.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Who?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—The prince. [<i>To <span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>.</i>] On
which side is he lying?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—Wait a moment. [<i>Reflects.</i>] On
his right side.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Then he is not lying on his heart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—No.... On his liver.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—That’s good. Now go back to your
post, Symphorosa, keep careful watch and report
everything to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—Yes, dear. [<i>She exits into the
garden.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Does my sister Symphorosa keep
watch over the Prince’s slumbers?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Yes. She is in constant touch with
the adjutant who, on his part, peeps through the
keyhole.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—And that goes on all day long?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—I have to keep informed about everything.
He is my guest. That is no light responsibility.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—And how long has he been here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Four days.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—How much longer is he staying?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—According to program, he goes to-morrow.
That’s why I wanted you here sooner.
He arrived unexpectedly, and here we were without
a man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—I started immediately I got your
telegram. Albert has changed, hasn’t he? He has
become quite an attractive young man. [<i>He sits.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—He is very agreeable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—He appeared genuinely glad to see
me. He almost wept when we met.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—He was very fond of my lamented
husband too. And he was only a child then.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—He embraced me cordially and kissed
me at least four times. And he fairly beamed when
he told me how much he loved you all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—That’s just it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—What’s “just it”?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—[<i>To <span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>.</i>] Will you go out
into the garden a while, my dear?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Yes, mother. [<i>She exits into the
garden.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—[<i>Dries her eyes.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—What’s wrong, my dear? Has anything
happened?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—[<i>Her glances follow <span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>
through the door out to the garden.</i>] I didn’t care
to speak of it in her presence. But that’s just it.
Nothing has happened.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—I don’t understand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Albert told you how much he loved
us all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Well, he has fallen in love with
everyone here ... except Alexandra.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—What did you expect in three days?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Not love, perhaps ... but at least
some sign of interest in the girl. But no. Not
the slightest advance. Though we did everything
we could.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Perhaps ... there are ... political
reasons....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—[<i>With a smile.</i>] You underestimate
me, Karl.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Forgive me.... I know you are the
best informed woman in Europe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—I’ll show you my correspondence.
Oh, I have no illusions on the subject. I know perfectly
well that the only reason they are considering
a marriage with us is because two or three royal
families have made simultaneous advances and they
can’t afford to offend any of them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—I see.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—And that is what makes me so anxious,
Karl. The Czar wants him for Olga—Constantine’s
daughter. Edward would have liked to
get him for England—for Patricia. Frederic has
been telegraphing me every day from Vienna, and
Amelie from St. Petersburg.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—So Albert must make up his mind
quickly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Rome is out of the question for him.
And so it is imperative for him to choose a wife
immediately.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Then he’ll go to Montenegro.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—That is just what I am afraid of.
He is a very obedient son. Dominica, his mother,
dominates him utterly. And she has sent him everywhere.
First to Dresden for Leopoldine Charlotte,
but he didn’t like her. She tends to corpulence.
From there he went to Portugal. The Infantin Silvina
Gonzaga. A most admirable girl, but incredibly
ugly. So on he went to Belgium, to Maria
Hermine, who is two heads taller than he is—And
he rightly decided that such an alliance would
make him look ridiculous in his people’s eyes. And
now he is here. And if we let him get away from us
his next stop will undoubtedly be Montenegro.
[<i>Dries her eyes. <span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span> enters from the
garden.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Well?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—He stretched his hand outside the
bed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—What for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—For his lemonade.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Was the lemonade there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—Yes, he drank it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—I was so afraid it mightn’t have been
there! And then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—Then he turned over and went to
sleep again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Thank you, dear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—Not at all, dear. [<i><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>
hurries off.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—[<i>Unhappily.</i>] These past three days
have been a great trial to me, Karl. I am absolutely
certain that he is here on account of Alexandra.
And yet he has treated the girl as if she
didn’t exist. And not a word, not a sign from his
mother, Dominica. If he had serious intentions,
she’d be here by this time. [<i>Weeps.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Beatrice!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—I am not myself. Think of it, we
have only one day more. This afternoon, the ball
to-night, and ... if nothing happens ... then
our chances are gone, perhaps forever.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—And not a sign?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Not one. I needn’t tell you how I
have watched for one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Perhaps Alexandra is——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—She is perfectly beautiful and clever
and self-possessed ... her poor father described
her perfectly when he called her his swan. “My
proud, white swan!” ... And she is just like that,—majestic,
silent, earnest ... holds her head
high ... conducts herself irreproachably. Yet
Albert is utterly indifferent to her. It’s disheartening!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Beatrice, it is not like you to lose
control of yourself like this.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—[<i>Nervously.</i>] I know, but I can’t
help it. This is my last great battle, not mine alone
but our family’s. Now or never. Well, I mean to
win if I ruin myself in the attempt. [<i><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>
speaks in the doorway.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—He is sleeping peacefully.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Thank you, dear. [<i><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>
vanishes.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—You mustn’t agitate yourself like
this. What will be, will be. And if it isn’t successful
this time, it will be next time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—When? Albert is thirty-five. And
Alexandra isn’t getting younger.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—How old is she?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>— ... and twenty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—What ... and twenty?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Nothing. Just “and twenty.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—That is a new number.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Yes, my dear. I invented it myself.
A mother’s invention.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—I see. So she is just “and twenty.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—But she can’t stay that way indefinitely.
She is ripening. In a political family that
wouldn’t matter. But our daughters must be beautiful.
My conscience has troubled me for making
the poor girl wait as long as she has.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—One can’t blame you for that. You
are a devoted mother, my dear. But you are aware
that our lives are ordered not for the individual’s
but for the family’s good. The happiest royal
family may be composed of unhappy individuals.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Poor Xara.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Who is that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Alexandra!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Is that what you call her now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—[<i>To <span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>, who is entering.</i>]
Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—The situation is unaltered. [<i>She
exits.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Karl, I want you to help us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—I? But, my angel, what can I do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—You, with your charming personality——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—But, my dear child, it isn’t me you
want him to marry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Oh, you—man! Don’t you understand
that everything attractive in the setting adds
luster to the girl?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—What does Alexandra think of the
matter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Just as I do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Has she said anything about it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—No, but she is worried. [<i><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>
enters quickly, her hand held agitatedly to her heart.</i>]
Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—He is awake. [<i><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span> makes a
gesture of displeasure.</i>] Count Luetzen coughed
outside his door.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—[<i>Quickly aghast.</i>] Accidentally?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—No, on purpose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Wasn’t the Colonel on guard?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—Certainly. Count Luetzen came
to the door expressly to cough.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Why didn’t the Colonel cough himself?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—Because his cough is too loud.
Count Luetzen coughs delicately. He always coughs
his highness awake.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—What happened when he awoke?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—He asked for eau de Cologne.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—And a cup of weak tea.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—Now don’t be alarmed, dear. He
got everything he asked for.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—And when is he coming to see the
boys?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—I forgot to ask.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—[<i>Excitedly.</i>] How could you? Hurry!
Run! [<i><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span> goes out swiftly.</i>] She had
to forget the most important thing of all! Heavens,
and I am sure the boys aren’t ready yet. [<i>Starts
off at right.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—[<i>Restraining her.</i>] This won’t do,
my dear. Calm yourself, don’t be over-anxious.
Everything will be all right. The boys must have
been ready long ago.... Really, dear ... this
isn’t a bit like you. You always had such poise,
such assurance——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—In times of peace, yes. But this is
war! I’ll go to meet him. You call the boys. My
God——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Calm yourself!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Now, Karl, you only make me more
nervous, talking like that. Can’t you see I’m in
the fever of the last hope ... the finish of the
race?... Now I must summon my last reserves
of strength.... To arms.... To arms.... To
arms! [<i><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span> enters breathlessly.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—He’s coming!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—When?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—Now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Immediately?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—Immediately, immediately! He has
started already. I ran on ahead.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Let’s go to meet him. [<i>Hurries into
the garden. <span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span> follows her.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—[<i>Calls through the doorway at
right.</i>] Well, aren’t you ready yet? [<i>The boys
and <span class="smcap">Agi</span> enter.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georg</span>—We’re ready. We’ve been waiting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arsen</span>—Is he coming?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—He’ll be here any minute. [<i>To <span class="smcap">Agi</span>.</i>]
Tell me, my son, have you altered your opinion
about Napoleon since our discussion?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—And suppose my sister requests you
to teach Napoleon according to her ideas.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Then I shall try to convince her highness——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—And if her highness still insists?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Then I shall regretfully take my leave.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Shake hands. [<i>Shakes his hand.</i>]
Now I know you better than I did a half hour
ago.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georg</span>—[<i>Who has been standing at the garden
door, looking out.</i>] They’re coming!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—You stay here. I’ll go to meet them.
[<i>Exits into the garden.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—[<i>At the table.</i>] We will stand here ...
around the table ... at the places where we
always sit. Prince Arsen there, Prince Georg there,
I here. And your highness, Georg, if you really
meant what you said before about being fond of
me——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georg</span>—Don’t worry. I’ll be good.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Just this once. If you behave well, I’ll
take you up to the observatory to-night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arsen</span>—[<i>Joyfully.</i>] The observatory!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—We’ll have a look at Capella and Vega, and
I’ll explain the entire summer firmament to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georg</span>—I’ll be gentle as a lamb. [<i>There is a
brief pause during which voices are heard in the
garden. <span class="smcap">Prince Albert</span> appears first. He is
young, elegant, gracious. He wears a general’s
uniform. He enters, chatting with <span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>.
After them come <span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>, <span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>, <span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>,
<span class="smcap">Luetzen</span>, <span class="smcap">Wunderlich</span>. All take positions
before the chairs where they will later sit.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—[<i>Very good-humoredly, continuing a
speech begun outside.</i>] ... and, being a soldier,
his cough is so incisive, so intrepid, so abrupt that
... really, you know, it wakes one with a start.
But Luetzen, on the other hand, Luetzen is a diplomat.
He can cough delicately, and melodiously
and suitably to every occasion. Luetzen can cough
for you in such a discreet, persuasive crescendo that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
you wake gradually and without shock. Curious
that personal peculiarities should extend even to
such things. Keen observation, what? Human.
C’est humain. [<i>Looks around.</i>] Eh bien! Hello,
you dear little boys. [<i>To <span class="smcap">Agi</span>, who bows profoundly.</i>]
Good morning! This would be the brilliant
young professor. What? [<i>A pause.</i>] Why
don’t you sit down? [<i>He sits. The others sit
simultaneously.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—[<i>Ingratiatingly.</i>] Did you rest well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—It is really astonishing how well I sleep
here. I don’t know whether it’s the fresh air, or
that excellent bed, or the pleasant surroundings
that soothe and refresh me so. A perfect balm to
my nerves ... really I am quite happy here. You
may laugh, but it’s true that I shall never forget
the days I have spent with you here. Dear Beatrice
... who thinks of everything for my comfort
... this fine old castle, this gently rolling landscape,
the peace, the harmony of the life you live
here.... Oh, I.... All I can say is that I have
fallen in love with you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—[<i>Sweetly.</i>] We are very happy,
Albert, to know that you are enjoying your visit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—[<i>Sweetly.</i>] We have no other aim,
Albert.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—At night, when I am alone, Beatrice, I
think of my poor father and your sainted husband<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
... Henry.... How often they strolled together
in this garden!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Talking about their children.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—They both were devoted fathers. They
dedicated their lives to the welfare of their children.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—They never tired of discussing their
children, you know. Always the children. The
future of the children. What would become of
them. How to direct them in the right path. [<i>Turns,
chair and all, toward <span class="smcap">Albert</span>; speaks with emphasis.</i>]
How some day the children would rear a
family of their own.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—[<i>To <span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>.</i>] Sometimes at night I
lean out of my window and fancy I see the two old
men walking arm in arm along the path between
those banks of beautiful roses——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—[<i>Edging her chair nearer <span class="smcap">Albert</span>.</i>]
They are Alexandra’s roses. [<i>A pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—How? <i>Your</i> roses?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Mine, yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—Did you plant them?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Only some of them. But I tend
them. [<i>A pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—And ... does that amuse you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Oh, yes. [<i>A pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—And ... don’t you ever prick yourself?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Sometimes. [<i>A pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—Why don’t you wear gloves?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—I usually do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—And ... yet you prick yourself?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Yes, through the gloves. [<i>A
pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—You ought to wear thicker gloves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Yes, I must try thicker ones.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—C’est ça! That’s life. One must be on
one’s guard.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—That’s perfectly true! How good of
you to be interested. Fancy! Such practical advice
too!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—[<i>Modestly.</i>] Oh, not at all ... only
... you see ... one picks up a bit of experience
here and there ... what? [<i>A pause, and then he
rises suddenly. They all stand up too.</i>] Well now,
let’s have a look at the boys. Is this your classroom?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arsen</span>—Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—You are sixteen, aren’t you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arsen</span>—Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—And you are seventeen?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georg</span>—Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—Time flies. They are popping up fast,
what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Indeed, yes, Albert.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—You doubtless suppose that I shall examine
you, like a school inspector.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georg</span>—No, we don’t.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—Have no fear.... I am a proper uncle.
I shall only question your excellent young teacher.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—[<i>To <span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>.</i>] He is falling in
love with him too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—I commend him warmly to your notice.
He is a man of culture and an athlete; an
astronomer and a swordsman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—[<i>Notices that they all are standing.</i>]
Why don’t you keep your seats? [<i><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>,
<span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>, <span class="smcap">Beatrice</span> and <span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span> sit; the
others do not</i>.] Good. I like that. It’s the modern
spirit. What are you working on now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—History, your highness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—Ah! That’s always interesting. What
period?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—The beginning of the Nineteenth Century.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—Napoleon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Yes, your highness. [<i>Embarrassment.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—You are interested in Pedagogy, aren’t
you, Karl?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—Did you know that Napoleon proposed
to establish a school for kings at Meudon?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—A very practical idea.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—Yes, the pupils were to have been limited
to boys in the line of succession to a throne.
The program of study was very interesting. No<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
details at all. General instruction along broad
lines. No science, only orientation; no theory, only
practice. La Cases writes about it in his memoirs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—He was the only one who could have
made it practical.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—Yes, yes, he could have made many
things practical. A capital idea, too! A school
from which you graduated with a monarch’s diploma
in hand. [<i>He laughs. The others respectfully
echo his laugh. <span class="smcap">Albert</span> looks around him.</i>]
Well!... I’m glad to find you such fine healthy
boys. Nice, deep-set eyes this chap has, what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—[<i>Rises.</i>] Exactly like Alexandra’s.
It is marvellous how alike their eyes are. He resembles
her in many ways.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—[<i>Taking no notice of her remark.</i>] You
oughtn’t read too much, my boy. That’s bad for
the eyes. Sailors have the nicest eyes because they
are accustomed to look upon vast distances. At
the sea and sky.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—He’d like that. He wants to be a
sailor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—And you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arsen</span>—I? An explorer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—Where?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arsen</span>—The Pole.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—Which Pole, my son?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arsen</span>—The South Pole.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—You are mistaken if you suppose it’s
any warmer there than at the North Pole. [<i>He
laughs.</i>] And when do you start?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—[<i>Puts her arms about <span class="smcap">Arsen</span>.</i>] He
starts this very moment with Georg to put on his
fencing things. Uncle Albert wants to see how well
you fence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—Indeed, yes, I am very much interested.
[<i>The boys bow.</i>] See you later. [<i>To <span class="smcap">Agi</span>.</i>] You
too, what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Yes, your highness, in the gymnasium.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—Do you teach them fencing too?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Yes, your highness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—Splendid! You <i>are</i> versatile, aren’t
you? See you later. [<i><span class="smcap">Agi</span> and the boys exit.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—[<i>Sits.</i>] He has a very tactful and
sympathetic manner, this tutor. I am charmed with
him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—I liked him the moment I laid eyes
on him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—And such a handsome young fellow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—[<i>To <span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>.</i>] I told you he’d
fall in love with him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—Don’t be upset about it, I beg
of you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—Hah! [<i>Rises suddenly.</i>] And while we
are waiting for the great fencing competition....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—We can show you a number of things<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
worth seeing. Now if you are interested in beautiful
roses, there is Alexandra’s own little rose-garden——
[<i><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span> rises.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—Oh, yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—[<i>Sweetly.</i>] The roses are her pride
and joy ... and there are some rare specimens
among them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—[<i>Without enthusiasm.</i>] Splendid! [<i>His
eyes seek out <span class="smcap">Wunderlich</span>.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wunderlich</span>—[<i>Comes forward.</i>] Your highness
may be interested in ... the new dairy I saw
here yesterday. An absolutely modern innovation.
They milk the cows by vacuum.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—By vacuum?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wunderlich</span>—Yes, your highness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—Like sucking up dust from a carpet?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wunderlich</span>—Exactly. It is most interesting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—But that sounds quite fantastic. One
really must look at it. I have never seen anything
like that before. [<i><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span> sits down.</i>] And did
you have it installed yourself, Aunt Beatrice?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—I installed it as an experiment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—You are really a remarkable woman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—If I may say so, Albert, the dairy
is quite far from here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—All the better. We need a little exercise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—As you please. We’ll go to the dairy
then.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—Oh, no.... I shouldn’t think of troubling
<i>you</i> to come with me. I’ll go with Luetzen and
the Colonel. We’ll make it a brisk walk.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—If you permit, I’ll join you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—No, I can’t have that. My sightseeing
needn’t inconvenience any of you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—But——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—No, no—— [<i>Starts to go.</i>] You
mustn’t feel obliged to run about with me as though
I were a stranger. Forward, march, Luetzen. Coming,
Colonel. When they are ready at the gymnasium
send someone after us. [<i>He is in the doorway
at left.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—I’ll telephone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—But we shall probably be among the
cows.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Yes, I know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—Is there a telephone there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—In every stall.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—You really are a wonderful woman. Incredible!
[<i>There is a pause; then he says suddenly</i>]
Adieu! [<i>Exits quickly into the garden
with <span class="smcap">Luetzen</span> and <span class="smcap">Wunderlich</span>. There it another
painful and dejected silence. <span class="smcap">Beatrice</span> sits down,
despairingly. <span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>, greatly offended, exits
at right.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Well, he disposed of the rose-garden
very neatly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—[<i>Rises.</i>] What did I tell you? Could
anything have been more pointed? You heard that
Colonel. I scarcely got the rose-garden out of my
mouth when he came forward with the cows.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—A coincidence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—[<i>Heatedly.</i>] Was it? Well, I shan’t
be beaten by such a coincidence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—I observed that your first attempts
in that direction were without conspicuous success.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—I shan’t give up as long as there is a
ray of hope, an hour of time left.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—What are you going to do now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—There is only one way left.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—What way?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Only one. A terrible way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—You alarm me, Beatrice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Yes, you may well be alarmed. For
what I propose to do is so reprehensible that, if
anyone else did it, I’d despise her all my life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—What in Heaven’s name are you
thinking of?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—God will forgive a mother anything she
does for her child. And a widow what she does for
the welfare of her family. [<i>She faces <span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span> with
tears in her eyes.</i>] You will forgive me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—I have forgiven you already, but tell
me what you mean to do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—I know you, Beatrice. When you
start talking in that strain there is only one bit of
advice I can give you. Don’t do it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—You will be good enough to hold your
tongue. The whole difficulty lies in the fact that
Albert’s interest in the girl had not been aroused.
His interest—as a man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—Merciful heaven!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Why? Does it begin so shockingly?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Rather disquietingly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Well, be prepared for worse. There
are certain grounds beyond which Alexandra may not
go. Alexandra can’t flirt with him, for instance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—I am beginning to be reassured.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Alexandra can’t ... throw herself at
him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—Thank God for that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—She wouldn’t be capable of such a
thing, and if she were, my pride wouldn’t permit it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Well, then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—A man’s interest in a woman ... can
best be aroused ... through the attentions of another
man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—How shocking!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Not yet. But it begins most curiously.
Go on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Once Albert is made to see the woman
in Alexandra, the rest will be easy for us. We have
no time to lose. He goes to-morrow.... And he
seems to have taken a fancy to the tutor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Ah!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—Beatrice!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—[<i>Greatly excited.</i>] Be still! Do you
think I am in the mood to consider your petty prejudices
now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—And what is it you propose to do with
the professor?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Invite him to the ball to-night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—The world will come to an end.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—And Alexandra will show him marked
attention.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—That ... that ... is worthy of
Machiavelli’s brain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—It would never have occurred to me
if Albert hadn’t praised the professor. It was he
who put the plan in my head. And it can’t fail. A
rival of his own rank might leave him quite indifferent
... but a mere tutor ... that is irresistible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—I shan’t live through it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—I command you to live through it.
Alexandra will be attentive to the tutor ... and
... and Alexandra will dance a quadrille with the
tutor. And God will forgive me, and God will forgive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
Alexandra. And I shall never forgive the tutor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—For what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—For putting me under obligation to
him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—[<i>Indignantly.</i>] Alexandra mayn’t
flirt with the Crown Prince, but she may flirt with a
tutor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—[<i>Dryly.</i>] That is quite different.
It’s like flirting with your horse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—Karl, how can you listen to such
dreadful proposals and be silent?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—They are not dreadful proposals.
They are mere feminine maneuvers which are not as
considerable as you suppose. There is something else
I am considering.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—The poor tutor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—What has the tutor got to do with it?
No one’s harming him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Tell me, my dear, has Alexandra ever
taken particular notice of the tutor before?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—How can you ask such a thing?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—That means she hasn’t. And what
do you suppose will happen, my dear, if she suddenly
takes notice of him now——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Oh, you needn’t be afraid it will inspire
the fellow with any false hopes. I’ll see to that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—I’m not so sure. The tutor is young<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
and temperamental. I admit I have no eye for such
things any more, but just now, when I saw them
together, it seemed to me that the young man looked
at Alexandra respectfully, yet adoringly. As a cat
might look at a canary in its cage, respecting it,
yet ... longing to devour it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—You are not trying to suggest that he
is in love with her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—No. But certainly his interest is
aroused.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—What of it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Only that it seems unjust to play with
the young fellow in that fashion, and then cast him
aside.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Am I to understand that your sympathies
are on the side of the tutor?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—My sympathies are on the side of
the humanities.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—The possible disappointment of a mere
tutor concerns you more than the happiness of your
sister and your niece, and the historical destiny of
your family.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—My dear sister, you have looked upon
this robe of mine so often that you have ceased to
notice it. It is true, I am more concerned with rectitude
and fair dealing than with all your schemes
about Albert’s throne and Alexandra’s crown....
I regard my fellow man not as a tool, but as a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
creature of God. In my younger days, when I maintained
a racing stable, I sometimes found it necessary
to enter one horse merely to lead and set the
pace for another horse, and at the finish to lag
behind and let him win the race. But that was a
horse, my dear sister. And whoever seeks to use a
man in that fashion; whoever holds the tranquillity
of a human soul so cheaply—she, my dear sister,
she has great need of the excuse that maternal love
impels her. That is my opinion, dear; and now I,
too, am going to look at that vacuum. [<i>He exits
quickly into the garden.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—[<i>With determination.</i>] Nothing shall
hinder me! Stop crying! I command you to put
that handkerchief away. I am desperate now. You
needn’t pay any attention to him. He always had
opinions, but never manners. If it had been left
to the men of our family we’d have been dethroned
as early as the eighteenth century. Go, and send
Alexandra in to me. [<i><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span> exits at right.
There is a brief pause before <span class="smcap">Alexandra</span> enters.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—You sent for me, mother?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Yes, my child. You are dearest to me
in all the world. My blood flows in your veins. You
will understand me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Yes, mother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Your will is as strong as my own.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Oh, yes, mother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—And if it falters you must lean on my
will for support, and make yourself as steadfast and
determined as I am.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Yes, mother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—You know what I am referring to, and
what it is I want. Do you want it as much as I do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>Calmly, earnestly.</i>] Yes, mother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Wounded vanity heals quickly. After
all, roses <i>are</i> more beautiful than cows.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Oh, mother——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—And there is no weapon more powerful
than will. You understand me, my child?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—I understand, but I don’t know what
you want me to do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—We mean to ask the professor to the
ball to-night. You will invite him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>Astonished.</i>] I, mother?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Yes, you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—The professor?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Yes. [<i>There are tears in her eyes.</i>]
I know it is a dreadful thing to ask of you, my child
... but desperate necessity compels me to. Don’t
hate your mother for it, my poor, dear child ...
love me, for I love you so....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>Calm and self-contained.</i>] Mother!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—[<i>Dries her eyes.</i>] Must I explain any
further? You understand, don’t you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—I understand you, mother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—I wanted to send to Vienna for a Duke,
but there wasn’t time. And that wouldn’t have served
as well, anyway——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>Coolly.</i>] As you wish. I shall invite
the professor to the ball to-night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—But not with that expression.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—I know, mother. With another expression.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—And you will promise him that [<i>bursts
into tears</i>]—that he may dance a quadrille with
you. [<i><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span> is silent.</i>] Well? Why don’t
you speak?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—This comes very suddenly, mother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—But our time is so short! Oh, if we
only had more time! Well! Speak!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Don’t misunderstand me, mother. I
only want a moment to get used to the thought.
The professor is a plain farmer’s son.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Alas!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—And when I think that my arm will
rest in his.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—You will wear long gloves, my child.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—It isn’t touching him that matters,
mother ... but the thought of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—He is one of God’s creatures, just as
we are.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—I’ll try to remember that, mother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Do you ask the flowers and the beasts
of the field who their ancestors were?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—No, mother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—[<i>Reassuringly.</i>] Of course not! You
are friendly with horses and squirrels and all sorts
of common animals, aren’t you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Yes, mother, from that point of view
it is a bit easier.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—There, you see, my dear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—But ... there is something else to
consider.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Speak freely. I will guide you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—He is a human being, isn’t he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—[<i>Without conviction.</i>] Oh, certainly,
certainly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—He is likely to <i>think</i> about it. And
that is the great difference between him and a
squirrel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—That is his affair.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—But it is possible that he may misunderstand
me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—You will do nothing that he can possibly
misunderstand. My mind is easy on that score.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Of course not, mother. And yet he
can’t help but notice my sudden change of manner
toward him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—That need give us no concern.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—But I must know what I am to do<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
if ... of course ... I only mentioned it because
one ought to think of everything ... if he should
feel attracted to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—[<i>In alarm.</i>] You haven’t noticed anything
of the kind?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—That must be thought of too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Have you ever noticed anything of the
kind in him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>Coldly.</i>] I never notice what I
don’t want to notice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—That means you have?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—I can’t say that, but ... he is not
at ease when he speaks to me. He is not at ease.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—That signifies nothing, my child.
Don’t let it concern you. It’s nothing to be ashamed
of. It happens so often. Underlings of all sorts
may be infatuated with a lady of high rank ...
officers, even physicians——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—But one mustn’t—notice such things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Heaven forbid! But then the underling
never dares to speak of his infatuation. Generally
he works out his own salvation. Often in a
most noble manner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—But then——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Don’t trouble yourself about anyone
else. Leave that to us. You need only keep your
eyes on the future, looking neither to the left nor to
the right, but always ahead of you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Yes, mother. [<i><span class="smcap">Alfred</span> enters at
right.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alfred</span>—The professor reports to your highness
that their young highnesses have put on their fencing
costumes and are awaiting your highness’ orders.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—The boys are to go to the gymnasium
and wait there. The professor is to come in here.
[<i><span class="smcap">Alfred</span> exits at right. With tears in her eyes,
<span class="smcap">Beatrice</span> turns to <span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>.</i>] Be strong, my
poor, dear child. [<i>Kisses her, presses her hands

stiff and formal at the door, awaiting orders. There
is a pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>Stands down left; speaks without
looking at him.</i>] To-night, ... I understand there
will be a rare astronomical spectacle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Yes, your highness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—What sort?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Vega and Capella may be seen to best advantage
to-night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—What is ... Vega?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—The chief star of Lyra. A green star which
is a thousand times brighter than the sun.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—And the other?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Capella. A golden star, very beautiful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—You intended to show them to the
boys to-night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Yes, your highness, in the tower.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—You love the stars.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Very much, your highness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—And you know all about them?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—I know very little about them, your highness.
But even that little is marvellously beautiful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—There will be no star-gazing to-night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—As your highness commands.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—We are having a farewell reception
to-night in honor of the Crown Prince. He goes
away to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Too bad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—The official personages of the neighborhood
have been asked to come. There won’t be
many. I have expressed the desire that ... you
be invited too. [<i><span class="smcap">Agi</span>, wide-eyed with astonishment,
comes a pace or two nearer.</i>] That is why I said you
couldn’t look at the stars to-night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—[<i>Modestly.</i>] I am very happy, your highness;
and if anything could make me happier, it is
the privilege of receiving the invitation from your
highness’ own lips.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—The reception is likely to be stiff and
formal. I hope you won’t be bored.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—I couldn’t be bored where your highness was.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—In case you do find the society of officials<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
and councillors tiresome, you may come to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—[<i>Astonished.</i>] If your highness will allow
me——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Then, for once, perhaps you may
speak to me about something else than fencing tricks.
That’s all you have ever spoken to me about.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—It wasn’t for me to choose, your highness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—You will talk to me about the
stars ... about the green star and the golden
star.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—I shall esteem it a privilege, your highness.
[<i>There is a pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Curious. I am a bit afraid of you
now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Why, your highness?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—You look so martial in that costume
and with that sword in your hand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Your highness has often seen me like this
... in the gymnasium.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—That was different. There I had a
sword in my hand too. But here I feel so defenseless.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Do I look so terrifying?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—I shouldn’t say—terrifying.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—What then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Rather aggressive.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—[<i>Astonished.</i>] It is curious, your highness
... but I have the unaccountable feeling that
I am wholly on the defensive ... now....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Well, then, you’ll come, won’t you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Yes, your highness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—And won’t you regret the green
star?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—No, your highness.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">The Ball.</span>—<i>A magnificent, brilliantly illuminated
room. Big double doors at left and right. High
arches in the back wall give out into a corridor,
and beyond each arch is a tall glass door, curtained
with some transparent material.</i></p>

<p class="noindent"><i>Down right a table is laid for seven. Two
tabourettes stand between the table and the
audience. Soft music can be heard off stage.
It is midnight.</i></p>

<p class="noindent"><i>When the curtain rises <span class="smcap">Cæsar</span> is pouring wine
into the glasses and putting the finishing touches
to the table arrangements. Finished, he goes to
the door at right and stands, immobile as a
statue.</i></p>

<p class="noindent"><i>The glass door back left opens; <span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>
enters. For a moment the music sounds louder,
a glimpse of people dancing can be seen; then
the door is closed.</i></p>

<p class="noindent"><i><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span> stops, looks back as if she is
expecting someone to follow her. After a brief
pause the door is opened again and <span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>
enters.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Did you beckon me to come out?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—What do you want? Why do you act
so mysteriously?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—I didn’t want to whisper to you
in there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Don’t be excited! What’s the matter?
Tell me calmly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—Beatrice, I think that Alexandra
has been sitting in that corner with the professor
altogether too long.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—For the first time in my life, Symphorosa,
I think you are right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—It seems to me she is going just a
bit further than is strictly necessary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Apparently I have made a mistake in
the size of the dose. But don’t worry, my dear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—She should be told that she has done
enough for the present. Let her keep away from the
professor a while.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Very well, Symphorosa, go and tell her
to keep away from the professor. Only how will you
tell her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—I’ll signal to her. Like this. [<i>She
indicates how.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—That’s right, my dear. [<i>Embraces
her affectionately.</i>] You are a darling!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—And you are the cleverest woman in
the world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Only the cleverest in this room.
[<i><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span> makes a gesture of protest.</i>] For in
the next room is a cleverer woman than I: my
daughter. [<i><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span> sighs.</i>] Don’t sigh. You’d
do better to admire her poise and tact. And the
effect it has had. Albert remarked to me twice that
to-night for the first time he has begun to notice
how beautiful she is. He won’t go away to-morrow.
Wait and see. And the day after to-morrow his
mother, Maria Dominica, will be here. [<i>Noticing
<span class="smcap">Symphorosa’s</span> impatience.</i>] You are impatient, my
dear. Well, go and signal to her. [<i><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>
hurries off into the ballroom. <span class="smcap">Beatrice</span> watches
her exit with a contented smile, then looks around
the room, sees <span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>.</i>] Cæsar!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>—Your highness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Is everything ready?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>—Yes, your highness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—The table?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>—Seven covers. For his royal highness, the
family, the adjutant and the professor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—You will be sure that the service is
flawless.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>—Your highness!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—What is the menu?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>—Everything his royal highness likes. His<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
excellency, Count Luetzen, was good enough to indicate
to me the dishes his royal highness prefers for
supper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—What are they?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>—Cold bouillon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>—Cold salmon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>—Cold beef.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>—With his own mustard.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—His own mustard?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>—With his royal highness’ own mustard.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—And what may that be?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>—His royal highness carries his own mustard
wherever he goes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—That is a new custom!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>—The chef says it is a very ancient custom.
Eminent Greeks of olden times always brought their
own spices to the table of their host.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Is the chef such a learned man?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>—Yes, your highness. He also told me that
the Greek gourmands used to wear a protective shell
over their tongues, which they only removed at meal-times.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—[<i>Gives him a look of stern reproof.</i>] I
didn’t ask you that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>—No, your highness. I took the liberty of
mentioning it as a curiosity....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—You will only answer my questions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>—Yes, your highness. And cold chicken.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—What’s that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>—Cold chicken—after the beef.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—What time will supper be served?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>—In twenty-four minutes, your highness.
And an ice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—The menu is too cold for me. In my
cup you will serve hot tea, without sugar.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>—I am afraid, your highness, that hot tea
may be distinguishable from the cold bouillon ...
by the vapor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—You will see to it that the hot tea has
no vapor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>—I don’t know just how that can be done,
your highness, but it will be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—I shall expect it to be. [<i><span class="smcap">Cæsar</span> steps
back as <span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span> re-enters.</i>] Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—I signaled to her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—And she stood up immediately.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Good. Now go and see that Arsen
puts those cold towels around his neck.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—What a perfect mother you are!</p>

Where is supper to be served from?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>—From here, your highness. [<i>He claps his
hands twice. A procession of servants enters, slowly,
single-file. <span class="smcap">Alfred</span>, platter in hand, comes first.
After him come two lackeys, each carrying a platter,
borne ceremonially aloft. In the rear are two Hussars
with champagne buckets. <span class="smcap">Alfred</span> and the two
lackeys go to the table and, their backs to the audience,
lay the three platters on the table. Simultaneously
the two Hussars deposit their buckets on
the floor near the wall at right. Then the Hussars
take their station to the left of the right hand arch
while the two lackeys stand in profile between the
arch and the doorway at right. <span class="smcap">Alfred</span> stands between
them, bowing.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>—Voilà!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Bravo, Cæsar! [<i>She hurries off into
the ballroom. <span class="smcap">Cæsar</span> bows profoundly.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>—[<i>When the door has closed behind
<span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>.</i>] Hussars! [<i>The Hussars come forward.
He inspects them from head to foot.</i>]
Right about, face! [<i>They obey the order. He adjusts
their tunics.</i>] Left face! [<i>They obey.</i>]
Very good. [<i>The Hussars step back.</i>] Alfred!

<p><span class="smcap">Alfred</span>—Javoll! Sie können sich bestimmt auf

gives them whispered orders. Meantime <span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>

deferential formality and blissful intimacy.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Cæsar!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>—Your highness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Is supper to be served in here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>—Yes, your highness. The guests will be
served at small tables in the yellow salon. His royal
highness and the family in here. Her highness, your
mother, was here just a moment ago.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Oh, then everything has been looked
after. How soon will supper be served?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>—In seventeen minutes. Has your highness
any orders?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Nothing, thank you. [<i><span class="smcap">Cæsar</span> returns
to the wine buckets. At his signal the Hussars

busy between the serving table and the supper table.
But he is listening.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—May I escort you back to the ballroom?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Please don’t.... I am afraid you
misunderstood me. When I said I was going in to
look at the table ... I ... I didn’t mean for you
to come with me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Your highness, I beg your pardon. [<i>Is
about to withdraw.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Wait ... don’t go. [<i>Embarrassed.</i>]
Perhaps I put it a bit too strongly. I didn’t mean
it that way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Please, your highness. [<i><span class="smcap">Cæsar</span> discreetly
exits back right.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Forgive me. I am unpracticed in
such things. I didn’t mean to be rude.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—I know, your highness. The reason I misunderstood
was because while I was in the midst of
my description of the constellation of the Eagle,
your highness suddenly stood up ... and so I
thought I ought to stand up too, and finish the sentence
on the way. I was saying that these seven
stars represent a flying eagle and that the eagle’s
head——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—That’s where I stood up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Yes. And it never occurred to me that you
were making your escape.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Your stars <i>were</i> beginning to get
tiresome.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—I am sorry, your highness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—I had expected to hear about the
mysteries and the miracles of the sky, and you spoke
only of names and numbers. I never knew the subject
was so tedious.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—The stars have their emotional side, too.
But I didn’t dare to speak of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Perhaps ... that might have been
more exciting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—I could have told you how across those vast
distances and beyond the millions of stars one’s
thoughts go on to God and His eternity ... to
life and death ... to life—[<i>softly</i>] and love.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>Coldly.</i>] Can your imagination
bridge such vast distances as that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—When I look up to you, your highness,—yes.
[<i>There is a pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>More coldly.</i>] And eternity, too?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—When I look down upon myself, your highness.
[<i>Another pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—And you believe in such miracles?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—If I didn’t believe in miracles, your highness,
how could I endure my life?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Is it so unendurable?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—It would be, if——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—If?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—If I hadn’t two—an outer and an inner
life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Have you? I never noticed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Because your highness believes in miracles,
too.... You believe my cold and impassive face
... cold and impassive ... even when it is slapped.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>In surprise.</i>] Is your face slapped?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Every day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Who slaps your face? [<i>He does not
answer.</i>] Who? Do we? Do I? [<i>He nods his
head.</i>] Without knowing it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—They are the worst slaps of all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—I must say ... this is more mysterious
than the stars. Do I hurt you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Every day your highness looks upon a
miracle. A man’s face, his voice, all his outward
appearance remain calm and unruffled ... while
inwardly he burns. And you never ask for the explanation
of the miracle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—The explanation?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—[<i>With rising passion.</i>] Why does your
highness suppose I endure it all? Why do I go on
teaching, humbly, silently and submissively? Why
do I stifle my individuality? Why am I here at all?
[<i><span class="smcap">Albert</span> enters at left with two ladies.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—I never thought——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—[<i>Good-humoredly interrupts.</i>] An ideal
daughter of the house! Before the concert she looks
after the musicians, and before supper she looks
after the table. Her watchful eye is everywhere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Lady</span>—Your highness ought to see her at
the hospital among the poor sick people.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—You mustn’t flatter me, Countess.
The praise is due to you and the other ladies. I am
there because it is my duty to be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second Lady</span>—Oh, your highness!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—Delightfully modest, isn’t she? I know.
You have the same noble character as your dear
mother. Good evening, Professor. [<i><span class="smcap">Agi</span> bows profoundly.
<span class="smcap">Albert</span> addresses the two ladies.</i>] A brilliant
fellow, this young man. [<i>Starts up right with
the two ladies.</i>] He is not only a scientifically
trained astronomer and teacher but also a swordsman
of the first rank. I saw him fencing with the boys
this afternoon; and I must say: C’était parfait,
absolutement parfait! [<i>Exits with the ladies as he
speaks.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Now you are more melancholy than
ever.... Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Shall I say it, your highness?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Is it anything I shouldn’t hear?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—[<i>Looking toward the door through which
<span class="smcap">Albert</span> has vanished.</i>] I am jealous, your highness.
[<i>There is a pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—I am grieved, Professor. Suddenly
you have made me remember ... those vast distances
you spoke of before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—To-night ... to-night they hadn’t seemed
so vast.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Yes ... to-night....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—To-night, for the first time, you looked at
me as if I were a human being ... a man....
Looked at me ... and said friendly ... intimate
things to me——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—I said nothing that——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—[<i>With growing boldness.</i>] What you said
... and did ... and looked ... bewildered me,
upset my balance, broke down my self-control ...
else I should never have spoken. There is a sort
of poetry in hopelessness. Until to-night, at least I
had that. It was beautiful in its way. But now
it’s gone, too. A pity!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—I don’t know what to say.... I
wish I could give it back to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—That’s beyond your power, little princess.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Don’t call me that, if you please.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—You see, I can’t speak to you the way I
used to. I am confused, your highness. But to-morrow
... to-morrow....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—No, no, ... it must be settled now.
I don’t want any more misunderstanding. I had
better tell you ... everything ... though I’m
terribly ashamed....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Your highness?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—No, no, I can’t tell you....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—I implore you, tell me. I—— [<i>Hopefully.</i>]
Tell me. Obey your heart. Take courage, and
tell me what above all things in the world I want to
hear....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—No, no; you are misunderstanding
me again. But it’s my fault. What I have to tell
you is quite painful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—What is it, your highness?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—It’s about a deception that has been
practiced on you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—A deception? [<i>There is a pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—You are a gentleman, and you respect
me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Your highness....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—And I can rely on your discretion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Absolutely?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Absolutely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Yes ... I know you to be a man
of honor and a friend of the family ... and I feel
that I shall never have peace of mind again until I
tell you.... My family ... my mother has but
one ambition in life,—to restore our family to its
throne. And to that end she wants me to marry
the Crown Prince.... You will understand ... it
is not easy for me to tell you this.... Every word
I speak is like blood ... flowing from a wound.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
... Professor ... the Crown Prince showed no interest
in me, and my mother decided ... that if
someone else were here ... some man ... to whom
I could be attentive ... Albert’s interest in me
... might be aroused.... I want you to believe,
Professor, that I never meant to hurt you ... and
that I am sorry, if I have. Before to-night ...
when I was cold and formal with you ... it was
because I knew that you were ... not at ease ...
in my presence. My mother asked me to invite you
to the ball to-night. I have never disobeyed her, but
if I had known ... if I could have foreseen ...
that a man’s eyes would light up like that when his
heart was aflame ... that anyone would dare ...
to look into my eyes ... as you have looked—— [<i>She
pauses, walks slowly to the table, sits down.</i>]
Now I have told you, Professor. Now you know
how you have been deceived. [<i>There is a pause.</i>]
Have you nothing to say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—[<i>His head is bowed.</i>] You only obeyed
orders.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—I don’t want to seem more blameless
than I am. It is hateful of me to put all the
blame on mother. [<i>After a pause, she continues
earnestly, dreamily, almost sadly.</i>] I want to be a
queen. [<i>Lets her head sink on her arm. There is
a pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—[<i>Softly.</i>] That means ... I may go now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Why do you say that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—I have served my purpose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>Rises.</i>] I am afraid I shouldn’t
have told you. How strangely you look at me!
[<i>The music stops.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Something is broken in me.... Why did
you tell me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Shouldn’t I have told you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Why did you tell me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Because I respect you. I want to
be friends with you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Do you? How touching!... Like the
good princess in the fairy tale. But I am not a lad
any more ... to believe in fairy tales.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Are you going to ... punish me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—I adore you ... humbly and hopelessly
again. [<i>Bitterly, earnestly, mockingly.</i>] You
needn’t be afraid of me. I know my place. I am
still an obedient servant to your illustrious family.
And what though I may be wounded a bit and bleeding,
I cannot but be honored by the exalted rôle
that has been entrusted to me. It is even beginning
to amuse and interest me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—You sound insincere.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Perhaps only bitter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>Uneasily.</i>] And I thought it was
a kindness to tell you the whole truth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—You have no further need of me. The bridegroom<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
has caught fire; the teacher cam be extinguished.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—I won’t have you think such things
of me, or say such things to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Have no fear. I am silent and I serve.
Don’t look at me so distrustfully. Let us smile and
act as if nothing has happened. [<i><span class="smcap">Albert</span> appears
at back.</i>] Can’t you smile? See, I can. We were
talking about the eagle. [<i>Louder.</i>] And the head
of the eagle—— [<i><span class="smcap">Albert</span> enters with <span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>
and the two ladies.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—Still here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—The professor has been telling me
such interesting things. There is an uncommon astronomical
spectacle to-night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—Where?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—[<i>Uneasily.</i>] In the sky, your highness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—I know that. But which stars?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—It is not really anything uncommon. Only
that a few so-called summer stars may be observed
to particularly good advantage to-night. Capella,
Arcturus, Vega and the constellation of the Eagle
[<i>with significance</i>], which consists of seven stars,
which seven stars form a flying eagle; and the head
of the eagle....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—[<i>Significantly.</i>] I had no idea this was
such an interesting night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>Nervously.</i>] And the head of the
eagle——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—You are very much interested in the
stars, aren’t you, Alexandra?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—I never thought much about them
until to-night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—Thought more about roses—what?
But to-night the sky is illuminated—what? A beautiful
summer night. [<i>Significantly.</i>] The stars
shine like eyes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—If you are interested, we have a very
good observatory in the tower.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—Have you? I didn’t know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Oh, only an amateur’s observatory.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—Doubtless the brilliant professor fitted
it up. The young man of a thousand talents ...
what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—No, your highness, it was here when I came.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—I wonder you didn’t mention it before.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—You go to bed so early. And the
stars have no regard for etiquette.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—Bravo! That retort was so clever the
Professor himself might have thought of it. What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—No, Albert. I thought of it myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—[<i>To <span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>, who has just entered
with <span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>.</i>] Did you hear what she said?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Who?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—Xara. She said the stars have no regard<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
for etiquette. [<i>A gong sounds. <span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>, the
two <span class="smcap">Hussars</span> and <span class="smcap">Alfred</span> enter. The <span class="smcap">Colonel</span>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—We dragged the doctor away from his
beloved stars to-night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—And also the poor boys.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—Yes, the poor boys looked forward
to it all day. They are delighted with any excuse for
not going to bed early.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Well, they can see them to-morrow.
Fortunately the stars are eternal, eh? One can always
put them off until to-morrow. [<i>The two ladies
exit back left.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—I didn’t know you had an observatory.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Oh, yes. Ever since my late brother-in-law,
Henry, bought a big telescope. You have
seen it often, colonel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wunderlich</span>—Oh, yes. Once I burned my tongue
up there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—With the telescope?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wunderlich</span>—No, your highness. There was
some acid in a cup up there, and I tasted it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—I can imagine what an impression
it must have made on you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wunderlich</span>—I shall never forget it, your highness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—I think, Albert, it is time to eat something.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—I hope to eat a great deal. I always
have a ravenous appetite at night. Haven’t I, Wunderlich?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wunderlich</span>—God be thanked, your highness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>To <span class="smcap">Agi</span>, low.</i>] I shouldn’t like
them to read in your face what we have been talking
about. [<i><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span> and <span class="smcap">Agi</span> stand down stage left;

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—Xara is absorbed in the science of the
stars.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—[<i>To <span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>.</i>] I’ll try, your highness,
but I am afraid it’s too late.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—[<i>To <span class="smcap">Albert</span>.</i>] She takes a keen interest
in the education of the boys. She supervises
their studies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—That sounds as if you are threatening
me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—Xara will be an astronomer yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Hardly a career to attract a woman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—I have offended you deeply.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Yes, your highness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Won’t you forgive me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—No, your highness. [<i><span class="smcap">Albert</span> comes slowly
toward <span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—[<i>To <span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>, in an agitated

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Don’t say such things to frighten me,

<span class="smcap">Agi</span>.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—[<i>As he joins <span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>.</i>] Xara, will
you leave the starry firmament, and come down to
earth a while? May I offer my arm?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>Takes his arm; nervously.</i>] What
an <i>unexpected</i> honor, your highness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—[<i>To <span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>.</i>] See how excited
he is. His ears are red. Better send him away
at once.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Leave him to me. I’ll send him away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—[<i>Escorting <span class="smcap">Alexandra</span> slowly to the
table.</i>] First you neglect me, and now you make
fun of me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—I neglect you? How can you say
that? [<i><span class="smcap">Agi</span> has slowly followed <span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—[<i>Intercepting him at center.</i>] You
seem to be in bad humor, Professor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—No, your highness. If you will permit me
to say so, this is the happiest night of my life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—But you do seem nervous ... and
agitated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—It’s the unaccustomed surroundings, your
highness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—[<i>At the table, to <span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>.</i>] You
seem agitated, my child. But no matter, you are
all the prettier when your cheeks are flushed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>At the table.</i>] I always get
flushed when I hear music.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—If you are tired, we will excuse you.
Don’t forget you must be up early in the morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—I am not tired, your highness. On the contrary
I am only beginning to be awake.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—[<i>To <span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>.</i>] Do you love music?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—[<i>Calls to him.</i>] She adores music.
She sings, too!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—And you never sang for me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—[<i>Who is standing with <span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>

are sleepy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Sleepy, your highness? Why, I just woke
up ... not five minutes ago.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>To <span class="smcap">Albert</span>.</i>] I hesitate to sing
for you. You know so much about music.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—I? About music? That’s capital!
Did you hear that, Wunderlich?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wunderlich</span>—I heard, your highness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—[<i>To <span class="smcap">Agi</span>, again obstructing his way.</i>]
You <i>are</i> in a bad humor, Professor. Suppose we
send your supper up to your room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—I’ll eat my supper here. [<i><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span> is
startled by his tone.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—Well, Aunt Beatrice, are you studying
astronomy, too? Do you want to starve us to
death?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—[<i>Hurries to the table.</i>] God forbid,
dear Albert.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—[<i>As she, too, goes to the table.</i>]
We are lost!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—I have always observed that my appetite
is keenest at night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—There you are like Louis XIV.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Shall we sit down? [<i><span class="smcap">Albert</span> and
<span class="smcap">Alexandra</span> sit.</i>] Sit here, Professor. [<i>Indicates
the place between <span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span> and her. But <span class="smcap">Agi</span>
sits next to <span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Thank you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Not there, Professor ... here!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—[<i>Does not stir.</i>] This will do very well,
thank you. [<i>Painful silence. Shaking his head,
<span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span> sits.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—[<i>Whispers to <span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>.</i>] We are
lost! I know there’s going to be a scandal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—The Bourbons had healthy appetites by
day as well. Louis XVIII. once consumed fifteen
lamb chops at a public dinner. Imagine how
much he must have eaten when no one was looking.
That disgusts you, doesn’t it, Beatrice? You are
not listening.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—[<i>Nervously.</i>] Indeed I am. Louis
XV. consumed eighteen lamb chops.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—No, it was the eighteenth Louis and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
fifteenth lamb chop. [<i>The lackeys, at the serving
table, are preparing to serve the soup.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—[<i>Sweetly.</i>] I hope you like cold
bouillon, Albert.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—My favorite summer beverage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—I am so glad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—[<i>Sweetly.</i>] What a fortunate coincidence!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—How long they are taking to serve it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Here it comes now, dear. [<i><span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>,
the two <span class="smcap">Hussars</span> and <span class="smcap">Alfred</span> serve the soup.</i>] You
can’t keep it on the table, for it gets warm. [<i>Each
is served, and tastes the soup. Ceremonial silence.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—[<i>Unexpectedly, though not loudly, breaks
the silence.</i>] And the head of the eagle—I really
must finish that sentence—is a star called Altair or
Alpha Aquilæ, the star whose brilliant green radiance
illuminates the sky to-night. That is what I
wanted to say.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—You had quite a difficult time reaching
the end of that sentence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—Doubtless the professor speaks so beautifully
because Xara likes to listen to him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—It was beautiful, but I didn’t understand
a word of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—I don’t know how to speak beautifully. Her
highness reproached me with it just a while ago.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—[<i>To <span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>.</i>] Did you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—[<i>To change the subject.</i>] Is the
soup cold enough, Albert? [<i>Music begins.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—Just right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wunderlich</span>—His highness likes his soup at eight
degrees Celsius.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Beautiful speech is not the most important
thing. What counts is the fact that he has
studied a great deal, and knows a great deal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Perhaps the reason I can’t speak well is that
I have never done anything but study.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—That never hurt you, my boy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—How many hours a day did you study?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Usually—ten.... And as many every
night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—Ten and ten are twenty. [<i>He rises.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—What are you looking for, my dear?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—The salt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wunderlich</span>—Here it is, your highness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—Thanks. [<i>Resumes his seat; takes the
salt.</i>] That left you four hours for sleep.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Not that many—sometimes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—That is very bad. I need fifteen hours’
sleep myself. [<i>A pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—I need eight. [<i>A pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—I need six. [<i>A pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—[<i>To <span class="smcap">Wunderlich</span>.</i>] And you?
[<i>A long pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wunderlich</span>—Two.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—It is a matter of individual habit. For instance,
Napoleon—— [<i>Stops suddenly. A painful
silence. Each sips his bouillon. The cups are put
down simultaneously.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—And so you can’t speak properly because
you’ve studied too much?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—The many things one takes in from books
must first dissolve themselves in the blood, your highness.
They must ferment like wine. Then only will
they release that beautiful bouquet, that fine
fragrance called poetry. There is a bit of poetry
in every man, but many things must happen before
it becomes articulate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—A pretty woman ... what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Perhaps....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—But ... Albert....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—It depends on the woman.... I
have met women who stifled the poetry in a man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—They are quite right. I don’t like
poets.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—It depends on the man.... I have met
men whom no woman can hurt. I envy them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Why? [<i>The bouillon cups are removed.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Because I am so easily hurt myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—By women?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—By any intense emotion. I am supersensitive,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
I suppose. What another man would only
laugh at—might do me irreparable injury.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—But that is really unnecessary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—I know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—And not very probable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—But I daresay you have had your experience
with women.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—No, your highness. Only with books.
[<i><span class="smcap">Alfred</span> serves from a platter. Only <span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>,
<span class="smcap">Albert</span> and <span class="smcap">Wunderlich</span> help themselves.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—Oh, come now!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—It is true, your highness. My first taste
of the world was here. I came here straight from
my books. And it would be a pity ... if anything
happened ... to drive me back to them again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—It <i>would</i> be a pity!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Please, don’t misunderstand me. It is not
myself I am thinking about ... but—I have a
mother ... and you see ... I am the only son
... all she has. And I have a sister, too....
She isn’t pretty, poor girl, but I have educated her
... done all I could for her. I’d like to see her
happily married ... and then—— [<i>Looks about
him.</i>] I beg your pardon, I didn’t realize I was the
only one speaking.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Go on. Go on.... I am very
much interested in what you are saying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—And there is also my old teacher, Dr. Waldbrott.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Of the University of Heidelberg?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Yes, father, he lectures there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—On what subject?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Astral Chemistry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—[<i>To <span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>.</i>] Tell me what that is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—The chemistry of the heavenly bodies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—I know the old gentleman. An admirable
man and an eminent scholar.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Yes, isn’t he? He ... honors me with his
confidence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—Chemistry of the heavenly bodies?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—Yes. [<i>There is a pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Dr. Waldbrott used to say to me that he
would die happy if he could be sure that I would
continue his life’s work. He has entrusted his two
great theories ... to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—I beg your pardon, but how many great
theories had he altogether?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Two.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—And he entrusted them both to you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—Good!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—It is a very important, a very serious trust,
your highness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—Certainly, certainly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—It carries a grave responsibility.... My
teacher, my mother and my sister ... it is only on
their account that I prize my insignificant life ...
when it ... [<i>looks at <span class="smcap">Alexandra</span></i>] when it’s in
danger. [<i>Silence. He raises his glass.</i>] I drink
to the welfare of the beautiful young princess.
[<i>Drains the glass in a single gulp. <span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>
nudges <span class="smcap">Beatrice</span> repeatedly with her elbow.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—Prosit! That was a mighty draught!
[<i>Smiling, he nudges his neighbors.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—That was the draught of a novice.
One doesn’t drink heavy wine like this so quickly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—I didn’t know, father. I never had the
pleasure of drinking it before.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Then let me introduce you with appropriate
ceremony. This is Tokay, my boy, and of
the very oldest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—And it is drunk with dessert, and not
with the soup.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—A two-fold error: you drank too soon
and you drank too much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—I didn’t know, father. I must own it was
the first glass of wine I ever drank in my life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Not really?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Really, father.... There, you see, that,
too, had to happen to-night. [<i><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span> empties
her own glass.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Alexandra!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—[<i>Takes <span class="smcap">Alexandra’s</span> glass.</i>] And I
had just finished saying that one doesn’t drink this
wine so fast.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—It’s plain to see why Xara did it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—To keep the professor in countenance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—It was quite unnecessary. You never
take any wine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—I do to-night, mother. [<i>To <span class="smcap">Albert</span>.</i>]
Albert ... see that this old professor gets
some appointment. Waldbrott—that was his name,
wasn’t it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Waldbrott—yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—If you wish it—I can write to Berlin.
Please, Wunderlich, make a note of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wunderlich</span>—[<i>Writes in his notebook.</i>] I am
making a note of it, your highness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—What sort of appointment can one
get for a man like that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—That’s just it—none at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—Surely the Emperor can do something
for him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Hardly, your highness. The man serves a
greater lord.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—A greater lord than the Emperor?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—One much greater. [<i>Points upwards.</i>] He
is an astronomer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—I should like to meet your sister.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—She is in Dresden, your highness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Do you love her very much?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Very much, your highness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—A stupid question to ask, wasn’t it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—[<i>Uneasily.</i>] Yes, my child, it was.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—No, your highness, it was a clever question
because it is a pleasure to answer it. I love my sister
with all my heart. In my darkest hours I think
of her. For she has the indomitable faith that I
cannot be crushed, that I am a world unto myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—[<i>Somewhat ironically.</i>] A whole world?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Yes, your highness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—How beautiful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—Isn’t that a great deal?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—[<i>Courageously.</i>] No, your highness. As
an astronomer one learns that the tiniest speck is
not to be despised. [<i>With significance.</i>] Those
little specks in the sky ... every single one ...
is a great world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—Every one?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—[<i>More bravely.</i>] Every one!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—[<i>A bit sharply.</i>] Perhaps they only
think so, these little specks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—[<i>Still more bravely, though not loudly.</i>]
Oh, I know it is difficult for the great lords to realize.
They say: “Ten million inhabitants make an
army of two millions.” ... Yet it is true that,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
among all these millions, each individual is a world in
himself, a world which may not be destroyed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—[<i>Uneasily.</i>] But, Professor, who is
trying to destroy any worlds?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Women, for example, do it with a smile.
[<i>To <span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>.</i>] Your highness, why do you look
at me so fixedly?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—I like what you are saying.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—[<i>To <span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>.</i>] And your highness looks
at me so uneasily. Perhaps you don’t like what
I’m saying.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—[<i>Coldly.</i>] That is not the tone in
which you are accustomed to speak to me, Professor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—[<i>Bitterly.</i>] I am in very good humor to-night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Better than we care for, Professor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>Soothingly.</i>] Mother, we are at a
ball and are drinking champagne.... [<i>Raises her
glass.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—I am astonished, Professor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—[<i>In alarm, suddenly.</i>] Albert, I
commend the salmon to you. It is the pride of our
chef.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—I say, he does put it well. That’s why
Xara is so interested. What’s that about the
salmon? [<i>To <span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>.</i>] Did you say something
about the salmon?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—It’s the pride of our chef.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—Oh, is it?... But what has that to
do with it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—Nothing. I just mentioned it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—Oh! Yes! Well! Little specks in the
sky. Astronomy. Romance. Empty phrases.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—[<i>Heatedly.</i>] No, not empty phrases, your
highness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—Oh, yes, they are. Phrases for women.
To impress them. Every star a world in itself!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—[<i>Belligerently.</i>] Not every star, your highness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—No?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—No. The big white moon, for example,
... it makes a huge, pretentious, glittering show,
yet it has no light of its own. It only reflects the
light of the sun. On the other hand, there is the
modest little star called Vega, which you seem to hold
in such contempt ... its light is a thousand times
stronger than the light of the sun. [<i><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>
nudges <span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—Its modesty is charming, under the circumstances.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—[<i>Sharply.</i>] It isn’t modesty, your highness.
It is only remoteness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—It is fitting for remote things to glimmer
modestly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—[<i>Openly truculent.</i>] It only seems so to
your highness. To me, because I know what it is,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
it shines in its true value; and so I proudly proclaim
that it is more brilliant than the sun, and that
its brilliance is its own.... [<i>Puts his hand on his
chest.</i>] Its own!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—[<i>Smiling.</i>] Possibly, Professor. It
seems I do not understand these things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—[<i>Decidedly.</i>] No, your highness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—[<i>To <span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span> in a harrowed whisper.</i>]
I can’t bear it any longer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—Charming! Charming! At last a man
who tells me to my face that there is something I do
not understand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—[<i>Stubbornly.</i>] No, your highness doesn’t
know anything about it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—[<i>Forcing himself to seem pleased.</i>] In
twenty years I haven’t heard anyone so outspoken.
Professor, I admire you not only as an astronomer,
but as a man. I am charmed with your candor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—[<i>As if offended.</i>] It makes no difference
to me whether you like it or not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—[<i>Jovially.</i>] There’s candor for you!
Charming! I’m really enjoying myself here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—[<i>Weakly.</i>] Oh! [<i>She rises suddenly,
sways. General consternation.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—[<i>Puts down his glass.</i>] What’s the
matter, Aunt Beatrice? [<i>He rises.</i>] Aunt Beatrice!
Tu te trouves mal?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—[<i>Weakly.</i>] My head ... all of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
sudden.... Laisse moi ... je vous en prie—forgive
me.... [<i><span class="smcap">Wunderlich</span> has gone to her assistance
and is supporting her.</i>] Merci, mon
colonel.... Never mind.... [<i>The <span class="smcap">Hussars</span> swiftly
draw the portières across both big arches. <span class="smcap">Wunderlich</span>
leaves <span class="smcap">Beatrice</span> and crosses to left.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—Tu te trouves mal, Tante Béatrice?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—I am sorry ... a little weakness
... please don’t bother ... I’ll retire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wunderlich</span>—[<i>To <span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>.</i>] Have that music
stopped. [<i><span class="smcap">Cæsar</span> whispers to <span class="smcap">Alfred</span>, who hurries
off. The music stops.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—[<i>Takes <span class="smcap">Beatrice’s</span> arm.</i>] I don’t
doubt that you exerted yourself too much to-day.
Let me see you to your room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Don’t bother, Albert. I’ll take her
up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—No, no. Stay here ... everybody.
[<i>To <span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>, who is about to accompany them.</i>]
Symphorosa, you stay here with the salmon. Please
sit down, Xara. No excitement. I’ll look after
her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—[<i>In a faint voice.</i>] No excitement
... with a houseful of strangers ... oh ... oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—All right, my dear ... everything will
be all right. [<i>To the others.</i>] I wish you all to remain
here, please. [<i>Goes toward left, supporting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
<span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>.</i>] As if nothing had happened. [<i>As he
passes <span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>.</i>] Why has the music stopped?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wunderlich</span>—[<i>Answers for <span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>.</i>] I thought
your highness would prefer no music during this
unfortunate——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—[<i>Leading <span class="smcap">Beatrice</span> slowly off.</i>] Let
the music continue. The more the better! [<i><span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Pardonnez moi ... merci, mon cher.

<p><span class="smcap">Wunderlich</span>—[<i>As he follows them.</i>] Music.
[<i>He looks at <span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>. There is a brief pause, and

their seats.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Is your highness ill, too?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Well, then——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—I don’t know what to do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Why not follow their highnesses? And let
the music continue. The more the better!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—[<i>Crosses to left; looks at <span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>.</i>]
What are you going to do? [<i><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>
rises, undecided.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Stay here. Your mother forbade you
to leave.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—[<i>To <span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>.</i>] And you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—See here, my dear; I love Beatrice<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
very much, but she has been having these delicate
attacks for thirty years. And I have seen too many
of them to be alarmed. If they strike her standing,
she sits down ... and if they strike her sitting,
she rises.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—Karl!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—[<i>Earnestly.</i>] The situation here is
much more serious. I warned you this afternoon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—What a misfortune! [<i>She exits at
left. <span class="smcap">Cæsar</span> withdraws. <span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>, <span class="smcap">Agi</span> and <span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—[<i>Severely.</i>] Well, my son, you see
what mischief you have done.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>Greatly agitated.</i>] It was my
fault, Hyacinth. I am entirely to blame. That
is why I stayed ... to....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Don’t excite yourself, my child. Let
us talk it over calmly. That is why I stayed. You
have nothing to fear while I am here. [<i>To <span class="smcap">Agi</span>.</i>]
But you have.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—[<i>Sits.</i>] No, father, I’m not afraid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—It wasn’t his fault. How deeply
hurt he must have been, to do such a thing! I am
so unhappy, Hyacinth! [<i>She buries her face in the
robe of <span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>, who it standing beside her.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Calm yourself, dear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—[<i>Rises; vehemently.</i>] I couldn’t endure it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
any longer, father, I couldn’t.... God is my witness,
I tried. But I am only human, father, and
... in love ... I hardly knew what I was saying....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Tell me, my son, are you angry with
me, too?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—How could I be, father?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Then don’t shout like that. I can
hear you. And I understand you too, my son.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—[<i>Grandiosely; excitedly.</i>] I am done for,
but I shan’t sell my life cheaply. Not even to this
beautiful daughter of a king. Yesterday—no, this
very afternoon, I would have given it for her handkerchief.
But now that blood has been let, I hold
it dearly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—What you have done——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—I am ready to face the consequences.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—I knew you would be, my son.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—[<i>Very grandiosely.</i>] I am ready to answer
for it: to anybody—to the family, to the prince, or
to his adjutant with swords or any weapons they
choose. But what I did I had to do. And there
is more I have to do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—More?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Yes, more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—And this is our serious young scientist!
[<i>To <span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>.</i>] Well, my girl, see what<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
we have come to. Here we are. [<i>Reproachfully.</i>]
How do you like it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Come here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—[<i>Goes to her.</i>] Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Sit down here. [<i>He does so.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Now ask me again how I like it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—How do you like it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>On his shoulder, low.</i>] Hyacinth
... I like it very much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—[<i>Astonished.</i>] Upon my soul! The
thing is worse than I thought. [<i>Moves nearer to
her.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>Still on his shoulder.</i>] Hyacinth
... dear Hyacinth ... I ... I....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Well, my child? What is it? Out
with it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Hyacinth ... that glass of wine
... it was the first I ever drank in my life, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—For a first drink it was a hearty one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>With a glance at <span class="smcap">Agi</span>.</i>] For his
sake, Hyacinth. So that they wouldn’t laugh at
him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Fancy that! You amaze me. And
how did it taste?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>Delighted.</i>] Made me ... fuddled
... and warm.... I wish I could die like<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
this ... but first I want the professor to forgive
me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—How <i>can</i> I forgive you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Silence! There, there, I forgive you
for him, my dear. [<i><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span> dries her tears.</i>]
Have your cry out, and don’t worry about it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—That’s not why I am crying, Hyacinth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Why, then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Because I ... am sorry ... for
him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—You needn’t be sorry for me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—[<i>Mildly.</i>] You are not to speak
now, my son.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—I have never been as sorry for anyone....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—And when he looks at you, you are
sorrier for him than ever.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>Looks at <span class="smcap">Agi</span>.</i>] When he looks at
me, his eyes scorch my face ... just as when you
open the door of a stove——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Yes, yes. The door of a stove. And
what then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>In child-like surprise.</i>] And then
... then ... his glance seems to enter my breast
... and touch ... my heart ... just as
you touch a key of the piano with one finger ...
very softly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—A key of the piano. Yes, yes ...
and what else?...</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—When he speaks ... since I hurt
him ... when he speaks, his voice rings in my consciousness
for a long time after.... Like a bell.
And that hurts. I pity him so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—[<i>Concerned.</i>] I see, my dear. Only
I am afraid it is neither remorse nor pity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—What then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—A bit of internal disorder ... the
lungs ... the heart.... [<i>Puts his ear to her
chest.</i>] Take a deep breath. Now sigh. [<i><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>
sighs.</i>] Say, “Professor.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>Looks at <span class="smcap">Agi</span>.</i>] Professor....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—[<i>Dryly.</i>] The heart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>Sorrowfully, reproachfully.</i>] You
are making fun of me, Hyacinth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Not at all, my child. The matter is
very serious. Tell me, dear. When ... did you
begin ... er ... to pity him so?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Before. Here in this room....
Quite suddenly.... He said something——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—What did he say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>Looks at <span class="smcap">Agi</span>.</i>] He will remember
the word.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—What was it, my son?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—I know, father. It was when I said that I,
too, was a world in myself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—No? Well, then it was before that ...
when I spoke of the poetry of hopelessness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Well, what was it he said that touched
you so?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>To <span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>.</i>] He said: “Lad.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Lad? [<i>She nods.</i>] What did he say
“lad” for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—He said he wasn’t a lad any more to
believe in fairy tales.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Oh, that was it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>Smiles happily as if in a dream.</i>]
You know ... I had always known the word, but
I had never heard it spoken before. We say “boy,”
don’t we?... And he, poor fellow, said “lad,”
with such a quaint lilt to it ... so sweetly ...
I knew at once it was what they used to call him at
home ... what his family calls him to this very
day.... And ... I don’t know why ... but
suddenly it seemed as if I, too, had been there ...
in the village where they called him “lad” ... I
saw the tiny, spotless cottages with acacia trees
around them ... and his mother ... and his sister
... who called him “lad” ... and loved him,
and were proud of him.... That was why.
[<i>There is a brief pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Well, my boy—what do you say to that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Hyacinth, what did you call him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—My lad ... of course, that’s what I meant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—You dear! [<i>Embraces him delightedly.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—[<i>While she embraces him, to <span class="smcap">Agi</span>.</i>]
See that? I understand women.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—[<i>Touched.</i>] She’s beautiful ... and good
... I’ve forgiven her long ago.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—But I can’t forgive myself. Never,
never! [<i>With a start.</i>] What are we thinking?
[<i>Suddenly.</i>] And poor mother.... [<i>She is
about to rise.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Stay, my child, I wouldn’t go up to
her now. Compose yourself first, and then we shall
go up together.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—[<i>Crosses to the table.</i>] Your mother was
very cruel. [<i>Sits at the place where <span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span> had
been sitting.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—I’m sorry for that too. I’m sorry
for everything now. And yet I’m so happy here.
[<i>Embraces <span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>.</i>] And you are sweet ... and
good ... and strong ... and you understand
one so well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—The curious thing about you two
is that I ought to be severe with you.... And I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
shall be severe with you. The moment you showed
signs of getting out of control your mother
dropped the reins. And now I must take them
in hand. [<i>Very gravely; rises.</i>] This affair must
end here, my dear children. It can’t go any further.
I trust you both realize that. Fortunately, you are
both too clever not to realize it. I am very sorry.
Sorry for you too, my son. [<i>More severely, to
<span class="smcap">Agi</span>.</i>] Your conduct here to-day.... Oh, you
needn’t be so depressed about it. How can I go
on when you look at me like that? Now, see here.
[<i>Begins over again.</i>] Your conduct to-day was—— [<i>His
tone changes.</i>] I wish you wouldn’t look at
me so knowingly. It confuses me. You are just
as bad as she is ... [<i>to <span class="smcap">Alexandra</span></i>] and you
needn’t look so pleased. You have no cause to....
This is unheard of! [<i>Walks a few paces.</i>] Unheard
of! [<i>Comes to a standstill; bursts out angrily.</i>]
You sit there. You don’t say a word. You just look
at me. And one can’t say what one means. [<i>To
<span class="smcap">Agi</span>, beginning all over again.</i>] Your conduct to-night
was ... I must say—— [<i>Cannot look <span class="smcap">Agi</span>
in the eye.</i>] I must say ... it was really ...
quite justifiable. There! I’ve said it. [<i>To <span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>,
crossly.</i>] Why do you look at me so affectionately?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>Delighted.</i>] You are looking at
me affectionately, Hyacinth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—[<i>Crossly.</i>] That’s the worst of it.
Yes, that’s the worst of it. When I look at you, I
... when I look at you ... like this.... Unheard
of! I look at you ... and my heart aches
for you.... But you ... you children ... you
are young ... unspoiled ... and I ... no, I
wasn’t born to be a judge. I try to be ... but I
try in vain. I can’t ... judge you. There you sit
... two fine young people ... and in such a desperate
plight ... but so happy in spite of it ...
you will never be as happy again. Happiness flies
past like the wind. You have scarcely felt it before
it is gone.... And then comes the reality, to which
you will awake to-morrow morning ... which will
separate you, and which will be for the best....
But it will hurt a little, my dear children. It will
hurt ... such things have happened before....
Even to me ... when I wore a uniform. A long, long
time ago. [<i>He turns away. There is a pause. He

your happiness. [<i>Raises the glass, sips the wine, sits

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—What is it, my friend?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>—[<i>Quietly.</i>] Her highness requests the
reverend father to go and see her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—At once?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>—Her highness used the word: “Immediately.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—She would send for me now, just as
I am beginning to enjoy my supper!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>—[<i>In consternation.</i>] Didn’t the reverend
father like the soup?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Soup? [<i>Rises.</i>] Bitter, hot tea is
what you gave me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>—Oh! Oh! Your reverence! What an
error! Oh, I could kill myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—I forbid you to kill yourself, though
I’m sure you had no such intention. And I’d forbid
you to scold the unfortunate waiter who made the
error, if I didn’t know you’d do it anyhow. I’ll be
back directly, children.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>Rises.</i>] But Hyacinth! We can’t
stay here alone. Hadn’t I better go with you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>—Her highness, the Princess Symphorosa,
asked her highness, your mother, whether she wanted
to see your highness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—What did she say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>—Her highness ... so to speak ...
expressed herself ... to the effect that——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—What did she say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>—Her highness said: “Let her keep out
of my sight.” [<i>There is a pause. <span class="smcap">Cæsar</span> steps

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—You see, my child! Just stay where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
you are while I speak to your mother. You needn’t
envy me the task. Then I shall come back and fetch
you. [<i>He exits at left. <span class="smcap">Alfred</span> exits. There is a

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>After the pause, during which she

even know your first name. What is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Hans.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—How old are you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Twenty-nine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Where were you born?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—In Transylvania.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—What district?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—[<i>In surprise.</i>] Your highness ... at last
we are left alone ... and you ask me questions
like a census taker.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>Embarrassed; helplessly.</i>] I want
to know you. I want to hear all about you as
quickly as possible. [<i>Almost in tears.</i>] But I don’t
know how to go about it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Have you thought of to-morrow morning?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—I don’t want to think about that
yet. The few moments we have together now ...
mustn’t be spoiled ... for you or for me——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—To-morrow they’ll sweep me out like rubbish.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—And what if I don’t let them, Hans?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Just the same, I shall go. Just the same.</p>

nothing. You may go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>—Yes, your highness. [<i>But he does not
move.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—You may go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>—Leave the room, your highness?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—At once, Cæsar.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>—Your highness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Yes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>—It appears that I myself served Father
Hyacinth the tea instead of soup. But then so

it is no wonder——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—You may go, Cæsar.</p>

a pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—[<i>After a glance into the ballroom.</i>] The
ballroom is empty. The guests are leaving.
[<i>Speaks softly with passionate warmth.</i>] And now
we are quite alone, princess. Perhaps only for a few<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
minutes ... and then all that was beautiful in my
life ... will be gone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>Trembling.</i>] I have never before
... been alone with a man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—[<i>Comes toward her.</i>] Are you afraid of
me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—I don’t know. But if it’s fear ...
then I want always to be afraid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—The last time ... perhaps the last moment
I shall see you. Do you love me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>Almost stammering; like a child.</i>]
If it’s love ... then ... it’s just the same as ...
when I was a little girl ... and the Emperor came.
[<i>He regards her in astonishment.</i>] Yes ... I had
seen many portraits of the Emperor ... with a
golden crown on his head ... in all his glitter and
glory ... and then once, when he visited us, in
civilian clothes—— [<i>Regretfully.</i>] I didn’t recognize
him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—My beautiful princess! [<i>Comes nearer to
her.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>Trembling.</i>] Don’t come too
near, Hans.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Are you so afraid of me? [<i>Takes her
hand.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>Draws back.</i>] I don’t like ...
you to touch me.... How cold your hand is!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—No. It’s yours that’s hot. What are you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
thinking that makes your hand tremble in mine?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Of something reckless, and——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—And of what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—And of my rank, Hans. [<i>There is
a pause. <span class="smcap">Alexandra</span> glances toward the table.</i>]
Won’t you have something to eat?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Why won’t you eat?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—I am not hungry. [<i>Turns to her ardently.</i>]
I’m thirsty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>Trembling.</i>] Will you drink
something?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—No. I am thirsty for you, for your mouth
and your eyes ... and your voice....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>Terrified.</i>] You mustn’t look at
me like that!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—[<i>Passionately.</i>] When I look into your
eyes ... deep into your eyes ... we seem to be
mounting together on the crest of a flame——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>In alarm.</i>] What do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Upward ... ever upward ... higher ...
along the path....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>Alarmed, child-like.</i>] What path
are you talking about?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—[<i>Coming nearer to her.</i>] The path you
pointed out to me.... Before, I lacked the courage
to realize ... that I am the rival of a king. But
now I know it. And now I know I have won. Before,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
I only stammered, but now, now I want to
sing ... because I have triumphed, triumphed over
every obstacle.... And now——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>Stares at him in terror.</i>] And
now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—I know that to-morrow my triumph will be
over. [<i>Takes her hands.</i>] But to-night, your
highness, we shall see who is king, he or I!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>Faint with terror.</i>] You frighten
me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—My silence should have frightened you
more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>Terrified.</i>] Now ... you want to
take your revenge....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—I love you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>Looks terror-stricken into his
eyes.</i>] How you hate me now——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—And I won’t have you pity me! Soon they
will all come back. Another minute and I’ll be a
servant again. A dismissed servant! Must it end
like that? Can’t I even make you arrogant again?
Can’t I make you insult me ... so that in my rage
I may take you in my arms and carry you off ...
out into the night ... among your roses ... and
kiss that haughty mouth.... [<i>He is about to
embrace her.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>Terrified, but resisting him affectionately
rather than resentfully.</i>] Hans! Hans!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>

do you want?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>—His highness, the Crown Prince, is preparing
to retire. He has received a telegram. His
mother, the Royal Princess Maria Dominica, is
coming to-morrow morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—His mother? Coming here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>—Yes, your highness! [<i>There is a long
pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>—I take the liberty to report that his
highness, the Crown Prince, will shortly pass through
this room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>Nervously.</i>] Hyacinth isn’t back
yet ... and we are here ... like this ... we
two....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>—If your highness should desire to go
through the yellow room ... there is still time.
[<i>He indicates the doors back left.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>Proudly.</i>] How dare you, Cæsar?
Are you drunk?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>—[<i>Tragically.</i>] No, your highness, I beg
pardon, I’m sure. I’ve only gone out of my mind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—That will do, Cæsar. [<i>He bows
and crosses to left. There is a pause. Through
the door at left come two lackeys bearing lighted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>

Xara, how fortunate still to find you here and bid
you good night. [<i>Extends his hand.</i>] I was to

you that my mother arrives in the morning. Or
did you know it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—They told me, Albert. I am very
glad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—She is extremely fond of you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—I am fond of her too, Albert, very.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—Your mother has gone to bed. But
she feels much better. She did a bit too much to-day.
I warned her not to. But she is such a
charming hostess, she wouldn’t heed my advice.

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Mother is never happier than when
she is making her guests comfortable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—But one shouldn’t overdo it. I have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
really reproached myself on her account. My
mother will scold me for it too. But, happily, it’s
nothing serious. Good night, Xara. [<i>Extends his
hand to her. <span class="smcap">Alexandra</span> courtesies low.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—[<i>As if he had just noticed <span class="smcap">Agi</span>.</i>] Ah,
the professor! Good night, Professor. Your discourse
was very interesting ... particularly the
manner of delivery.... Very original, yes ... a
bit belligerent, but original. As her highness was
taken ill so suddenly, I hadn’t the opportunity to
offer my very humble comment. I would never have
supposed that you could be such an insubordinate
young fool.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>Uneasily, forcing a smile.</i>] Albert,
you are mistaken——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—No, no, these astronomical impertinences
are very interesting. [<i>To <span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>.</i>] He
sat down with us quite unassumingly and then with
a flourish he lifted us up to the sky ... and he
stayed up there ... and dropped me with a
thud.... [<i>To <span class="smcap">Agi</span>.</i>] But you spoke with spirit.
Very smart.... Always higher, higher——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Pardon me, but your sarcastic
criticism is unjust, Albert. He is not like us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—I noticed that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>More and more excitedly.</i>] He
is a scientist; he is a free spirit.... He has the
right to speak more freely than we....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—You defend his bad manners just as
graciously as you suffered them a while ago. You
are a brave and clever girl—a perfect martyr. I
have just learned from your mother that you ...
[<i>sarcastically</i>] were the innocent target of certain
unwelcome attentions ... and that you have endured
them with such patience, such goodness....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>Very agitated; looks from <span class="smcap">Albert</span>
to <span class="smcap">Agi</span> in fear that they will quarrel.</i>] Mother is
mistaken, Albert. And you judge him wrongly.
You don’t understand him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—[<i>Ironically.</i>] It is not easy to understand
him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>Excitedly.</i>] You can’t possibly
understand him. [<i><span class="smcap">Albert</span> laughs mockingly.</i>]
Don’t laugh at him, Albert. He is a scientist and
a poet.... He is an astronomer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—An ill-bred little astronomer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—[<i>With a threatening movement.</i>] Your
highness!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>Trembling with excitement; passionately.</i>]
Albert, you are going too far. You
must not say that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—But he is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—I won’t have him insulted ... like
this——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—[<i>To <span class="smcap">Albert</span>.</i>] Your highness, I——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—[<i>Quite composed.</i>] You are an impertinent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>

Hans! [<i>For a moment she hesitates, looks at
<span class="smcap">Albert</span>, then throws herself on <span class="smcap">Agi</span>, embraces him
passionately, kisses him and rests a moment against
his chest. On the thresholds of the four doors
the people stand as follows: At left, <span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>;
at right, two lackeys with candles, and <span class="smcap">Luetzen</span>;
back right, <span class="smcap">Wunderlich</span> alone. At the moment
of the kiss they all withdraw slowly. <span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>
does not go. He only takes a few steps backwards.
<span class="smcap">Alexandra</span> releases <span class="smcap">Agi</span>, stands a moment stiff
and staring, then leans half fainting against the
edge of the table.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—[<i>Lightly, softly, ironically.</i>] Oh!
That’s different. Quite different. In that case ...
I beg your pardon, Professor. [<i>Makes a military
bow to <span class="smcap">Alexandra</span> and <span class="smcap">Agi</span>.</i>] Good night. [<i>He
exits at right. There is a pause. <span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>
enters at left and leads the half swooning <span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>
gently, tenderly off back left. When they
both have gone, <span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span> approaches <span class="smcap">Agi</span> gravely,
almost threateningly, stops in front of him and
kisses him suddenly. Smiling graciously, <span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>
hurries off at left. <span class="smcap">Agi</span> stares after him.</i>]</p>

Doors at right and left. At back, on the left,

<span class="smcap">Chambermaid</span>.</i></p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—We do not know how soon her
highness Maria Dominica may arrive. Her telegram
said this morning, but there is no train in the
morning, so she must be coming by motor. That
means we may look for her at any moment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chambermaid</span>—Yes, your highness. [<i><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>
enters at left.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—[<i>Hurries to her and embraces
her.</i>] Darling ... why are you up so early? It’s
barely seven o’clock. There, there!... Do you
feel better?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—[<i>Unhappily.</i>] I haven’t slept. I
never closed an eye, I was so restless.... Is the
guest suite ready?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chambermaid</span>—Everything is in perfect order.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—[<i>Tearfully.</i>] The bath?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chambermaid</span>—We have just lit the fire. The
water will be warm in half an hour. [<i>At a nod
from <span class="smcap">Beatrice</span> she exits at right.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Is she to have these three rooms?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—Yes. This salon—— [<i>Points to
the right</i>] and that one; the bedroom with the
dressing room; and the bath. [<i><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span> dries her
eyes.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—Don’t cry, dear. The good Lord
will help us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Only He <i>can</i> help us now. When
does Dominica arrive?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—Can’t tell exactly. She is coming
by motor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—If she had only come yesterday—even
yesterday evening——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—[<i>Sighs.</i>] Ah, yes....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—This beautiful summer day! And to
think that it is the most tragic day of my life!
Could you ever have believed that Maria Dominica
would be on her way to ask my daughter’s hand in
marriage with her son ... and I awaiting her in
tears? [<i>Weeps.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—My dear! [<i>Embraces her.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—How <i>is</i> Albert?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—He is asleep.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Fortunate man! And Alexandra?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—She came down at six, and went<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
riding. Alone. I hear you talked with her last
night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Yes. She came to my bedside at
three o’clock. Oh, that I had been spared that interview!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—Was she disrespectful?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—No, she was repentant. She told me
everything—everything that happened.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—The very last thing too?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—If only she hadn’t told me that!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—What did you say to her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Not a word. I wasn’t able to. My
whole body turned to ice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—What did she do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Kissed my hand and went out. I
haven’t seen her since. [<i>A brief pause.</i>] That
man—is he still here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—He is here—but——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—[<i>Explosively.</i>] He is here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—Yes, but——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—There is no <i>but</i> which can justify
his being here still.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>— ... But he is packing his trunk.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—[<i>To the <span class="smcap">Chambermaid</span> who has entered
at right.</i>] Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chambermaid</span>—Your highness, a motor is entering
the grounds. You can see it from the window.
There are two ladies in it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Now my Calvary begins. Symphorosa—don’t
leave me. Where is Hyacinth?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—Gone out for a walk.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—I don’t want to see him. Last night
I sent for him to give him a scolding.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—Yes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—And he scolded me instead. Let him
keep out of my sight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—Why are you so angry with him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Because he was right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>—[<i>Enters at left.</i>] Your highness, the
motor has driven up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—We’re coming, we’re coming. [<i>She
exits quickly with <span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>. <span class="smcap">Cæsar</span> exits at
back. The door remains open. Off stage their
voices are heard in an exchange of greetings.
<span class="smcap">Dominica</span> enters with <span class="smcap">Beatrice</span> and <span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>.
She wears a motoring coat. Behind her comes the
<span class="smcap">Countess</span>, who helps her off with the coat, hat and
veil and gives them to the <span class="smcap">Chambermaid</span>, who exits
at right, taking the things with her.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—[<i>Animatedly continuing the conversation
begun outside.</i>] ... simply by starting at
four this morning, my dear. I’m not fond of travelling
by day in the summertime. I can’t endure
the heat. The car ran beautifully. Barely three
hours. And the distance is over two hundred kilometers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Well, what time did you rise?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—At half-past two. While you were
still dancing here. [<i><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span> sighs.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—What an energetic woman you are,
Dominica! How youthful!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—[<i>With spiritual fervor.</i>] There is
nothing I can’t be ... for my son. [<i><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>
sighs.</i>] That’s the second time you have sighed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—I was thinking of my poor dear husband.
How fond he was of you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—I was fond of him too ... very.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Symphorosa, will you go and see that
everything is ready? We hadn’t expected you so
early.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—I didn’t telegraph the hour of my
arrival because you never can be sure when you are
motoring. But I don’t mind waiting. [<i>Sits.</i>]
What a joy it is to sit down again without having a
landscape rushing past you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—Excuse me, dear, while I see that
everything has been made comfortable for you.
[<i>She exits at right.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Will you have breakfast now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—Later, thank you. We had some tea
before we started. If you please, Countess, tell
Luetzen he is not to awaken my son on my account,
not before his accustomed hour. [<i>The <span class="smcap">Countess<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span></span>
exits at right.</i>] I hear you were up late last night,
dissipating with Albert. He likes that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Oh ... he is so gracious ... so easy
to entertain....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—Don’t be modest. I daresay you contrived
all sorts of schemes to amuse and entertain
him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—[<i>Bitterly.</i>] We did our best, of
course.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—And now, my dear, let us come to
the point. I am a simple, practical woman, you
know. They haven’t nicknamed me “the cook” in
Vienna for nothing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—Tut, tut! I know that’s what they
call me, and I am proud of it. But, first of all,
give me a nice kiss. [<i>They stand up and kiss.</i>]
That’s right! [<i>They sit.</i>] And now to business.
You realize why I am here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Oh, Dominica!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—In a word: My son wishes to marry
your daughter. [<i>They rise again, kiss, and sit
down. <span class="smcap">Beatrice</span> weeps.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—Don’t cry, Beatrice. This is nothing
to cry about.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—No, certainly not ... but I am so
overwhelmed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—Compose yourself, dear. Albert telegraphed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
me yesterday that he didn’t trust himself
to speak to you about Alexandra without me. You
know he never makes a step without me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—A good, dutiful son.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—Yes, so he is. [<i>Majestically.</i>]
Happy the people who get such a king.... But
there! He asked me to come at once so that he
might tell her how enchanted he is with her. [<i>Both
rise, embrace and kiss each other, then sit down.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Oh, my dear Dominica!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—I don’t wonder. She is such a perfect
creature,—beautiful, good, clever and queenly.
That is what I admire most about her—her proud,
imperious ways.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—How nice of you to say so!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—Haven’t you noticed that in the past
ten years our young women have become infected
with a certain rather vulgar freedom of manner,
imported from foreign countries? Not she. She
is grave, majestic, aloof, perhaps a bit too aloof
... I mean a bit too cold toward her inferiors.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Cold? Oh, I wouldn’t say that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—That is precisely what I admire in
her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—She has altered of late. She is quite
warm to her inferiors now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—To think that the desire of my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
sainted husband is at last to be fulfilled! This
marriage, you know, was his——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—His most cherished wish. [<i>Sighs.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—I am very happy, Beatrice, that the
obstacles which lay in the way of this marriage are
vanished. Now Albert can follow the call of his
heart. [<i>She sighs deeply.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Now it’s you who sighed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—I don’t deny it, Beatrice. It is no
great credit to our diplomats that my son must
marry for love. It grieves me to think that the
incompetence of our diplomats should compel my
son to follow the call of his heart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Perhaps he’ll be happier for it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—If we had had a Metternich, Albert
might have been very unhappy, but then there would
have been a real marriage. Don’t be angry at my
candor.... One’s Family, you know!... We
are not what we are—to strive for <i>personal</i> happiness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Alas, no.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—If you knew what Albert has gone
through. First that Russian girl, Olga Constantinovna....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Oh, I know. And then the English
girl, Patricia.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—You know that, too?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—I have followed his political career<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
with the utmost interest. And then, in Dresden,
came Leopoldine Charlotte ... the fat one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—How well you know everything! From
there he went to Portugal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—In the middle of July ... Silvina
Gonzaga, that odious infanta.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—Odious? That doesn’t describe her.
Perhaps there is a word for it in Portuguese. In
any case “odious” is quite inadequate. And then
came that amazing affair with Marie Hermine in
Brussels.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—She is fully two heads taller than Albert.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—Yes. But we never knew it because
she had always sent us bust portraits.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Yes, I know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—How perfectly charming of you to
<i>know</i> everything!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Oh, well, you see, I have regarded
Albert as one of the family ever since he was a
child. [<i><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span> enters at back.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Welcome, Dominica. [<i>Embraces
her.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—Karl!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—[<i>Crosses to <span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>, kisses her on
the forehead.</i>] Good morning, Beatrice. You are
looking splendid, Dominica.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—You, of all people! Are you here for
a holiday?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Only for a few days. But perhaps
I am interrupting your——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—Not at all. Well, here I am, and
you know why I am here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—And I am delighted. [<i>Takes her
hand; kisses it.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—We were just talking of how my poor
son had been tossed about by the exigencies of politics
before he arrived at last in the calm, happy
harbor of your dear family. Olga Constantinovna——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Of the blue eyes. A magnificent girl.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—Do you know her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—I danced with her mother in Munich.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—Odd to hear you say that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Oh, in those days——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—She really was a beautiful girl. But
politics, you know. And when King Edward left
Marienbad that ended all hope of an alliance with
England. Whereupon the English princess began
studying the Bulgarian language. With an eye to
the Bulgarian crown prince.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—What did Albert do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—We sent him on a trip into Africa
to heal his broken heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—And Patricia learned to speak Bulgarian.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—Fluently. But nothing came of that
either. She was married in Sweden to Prince Olaf.
Now, with all her Bulgarian erudition, she lives
among the Swedes. I hear that the Bulgarian minister
to Stockholm is delirious with joy because she
always speaks Bulgarian with him. And out of
that, between Sweden and Bulgaria ... came an
enormous trade in pig iron. To this day the good
Bulgarians do not dream to what they owe all
that iron.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—And don’t you know why nothing
came of the Bulgarian marriage?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—I understand that the Serbs thwarted
Delcassé’s schemes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—That is the official explanation. The
real reason is more interesting. Patricia’s family
sent Arthur and the Bulgarian court sent Philip
for a final conference. As you know, Arthur can’t
hear a thing with his left ear, and Philip is totally
deaf in his right ear. At the court dinner, where
the conference was to take place, they were seated
side by side, in the order that rank and etiquette
demanded, so that each had his deaf ear turned to
the other. But neither of them realized it. In the
beginning each spoke a few words, but receiving no
answer, became offended and said no more. Both<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
of them went home in a rage and that is how Patricia
came to be a Swedish princess, and why there is so
much pig iron in Bulgaria to-day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—I never heard that story before. And
so, Dominica, you are taking our little girl away
from us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—Yes, Karl. Is she still asleep?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—No. She went riding early this
morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—When can I see her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—[<i>In a panic.</i>] When can you see
her?... Ah-h-h ... God! [<i>She is greatly distressed;
presses her hand to her forehead.</i>] My
head.... Oh! [<i>Sways weakly.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—[<i>Forcibly.</i>] My dear, I beg of you,
I sincerely urge you not to be ill; I forbid you to
be ill.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—What’s the matter with you, dear?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—It started last night ... at supper
... a sudden weak spell....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—It was very inconsiderate of you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—But Karl——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—If you really don’t feel well——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—What if she <i>doesn’t</i> feel well? I don’t
feel so well myself just now. I forbid you to faint....
Sit down. [<i>With an expression of dread,
<span class="smcap">Beatrice</span> sits.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—[<i>Goes to her in alarm.</i>] But what
is the matter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—[<i>Restraining her.</i>] I shall tell you,
Dominica.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—[<i>Terrified; quavering.</i>] Karl! Karl!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Peace! Let me speak now. Dominica,
you are regarded—and not without reason—as
the cleverest woman in Europe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—But Karl!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Now don’t be modest. You’ll be
needing all your cleverness in a moment. For we
have a bit of a difficulty here. I don’t consider it
so, but Beatrice, apprehensive as usual, does....
Something has happened, Dominica.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—Jesus and Mary! Not to Alexandra?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—There! Didn’t I say she was the
cleverest woman in——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—Something has happened ... to
Alexandra?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—No, but almost.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—[<i>Terrified.</i>] Karl!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—Good heavens!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—I implore you, don’t you faint too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—Karl! You terrify me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—On the contrary. I am reassuring
you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—What happened, in heaven’s name?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Simply this—that since Albert came
here he has conducted himself like a fish.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—Like a fish? [<i><span class="smcap">Dominica</span> is sitting at
left, <span class="smcap">Beatrice</span> at right and <span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span> stands between
them.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—How can you say such a thing?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—It is true. He was cold and mute.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—Poor Albert! That was on my account.
He wanted me to be here before he——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—No one in the world could have suspected
that. Least of all Alexandra, who was quite
attracted by him and who was deeply wounded by
his indifference.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—Did he make it as conspicuous as
that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—It couldn’t possibly have been more
conspicuous. He is a very good son, but a very
bad marriage candidate. Just the same, your son
is idolized here. Both by the girl and by her good
mother. [<i>His gesture indicates <span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—You dear, sweet——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Oh, Dominica, if you only knew ...
if you only knew——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—And amid all this adoration he
strutted like a ... like a....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—Fish.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Worse than that! The girl didn’t
sleep ... wept all night long....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—How terrible!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—And we all suffered with her ...
her mother, I, the boys, the professor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—[<i>Suspiciously.</i>] What professor?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—[<i>Mopping his brow.</i>] That’s just
it. [<i>With a glance at <span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>.</i>] There is a
teacher here, a tutor to the boys. A nice, cultured
straightforward young man. And he ... well ...
toward the end ... when everyone was desperate
... an extraordinary thing occurred, which was,
indeed, only another proof of the adoration in which
your son——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—[<i>Terrified; beseechingly.</i>] Karl!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—Go on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—With characteristic feminine logic it
was deemed expedient to invite the professor to last
night’s reception ... in order to stimulate Albert’s
interest a bit. A stupid idea, of course ... but
from it you can glean the somewhat ecstatic regard
in which your son is held here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—What a charming, naïve idea!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Wasn’t it? [<i>Flashes <span class="smcap">Beatrice</span> a
triumphant glance.</i>] Yes, and then came something
which hadn’t been reckoned with. This professor—a
fine, a serious, a most estimable young man—it
appeared that he—think of it—that he had been
secretly in love with Alexandra. [<i>In terror <span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>
rises. There is a brief pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—[<i>Emphatically.</i>] Such things happen.
[<i>Reassured, <span class="smcap">Beatrice</span> sits down.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—[<i>With a triumphant glance at
<span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>.</i>] Yes, and no wonder. He sees her
every day. She is beautiful. The rest was inevitable.
Think of all those ancient romances of the
Tutor and the Princess——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—What then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Put yourself in this poor young
man’s place. Though desperately in love, he lends
himself to this innocent deception, knowing, poor
fellow, that he is only a means to an end.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—It was all Albert’s fault. Why did
he hesitate to speak? I consider his reticence exaggerated
under the circumstances.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Remember it was out of consideration
for you. Really, Albert’s devotion to you borders
on the fantastic.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—After all, it <i>is</i> gratifying. [<i>With
tears in her eyes.</i>] Well, and then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—[<i>Mopping his brow.</i>] Well, as I
said, this young man sat down to supper with
me ... this martyr ... I really must call him
that ... this wretched human sacrifice ... and
there at the table he endured such tortures that
tears came to my eyes, watching him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—I don’t wonder. It is really quite
touching.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—And the poor girl, who is tender-hearted
as she can be, could not bear to see him
suffer so ... and she would have sent him away
... but the professor ... solely for the sake of
the family ... solely for Alexandra’s sake ...
solely for the sake of your son’s happiness ... the
professor played the comedy through, though his
heart was bleeding....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—Poor fellow....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>— ... Until Albert, who knew nothing
of all this, insulted him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—[<i>Horrified.</i>] The professor?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Yes, him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—This poor young man?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—This poor young man. Think of it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—What did Albert do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—He called him an impertinent little
upstart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—Terrible! And didn’t you interfere?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—How could I?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—What did the young man do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—What could he do? He bowed his
head. I thought my heart would break.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—Poor, brave fellow! And what did
Alexandra say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—[<i>Mopping his brow.</i>] I am glad
that you, too, are sorry for this nice young man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—What did Alexandra do?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—You are not only clever but sympathetic
as well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—And Alexandra?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—If you could only have seen him
standing there, this poor, industrious scientist....
Would you believe it? An astronomer! With his
hopeless, despairing, inarticulate love; with his shattered
romance; with his bleeding heart ... and
Albert insulting him with cold, withering elegance....
And there he stood with bowed head ... disgraced
irreparably ... annihilated ... after he
had made such a sacrifice for the family.... Can
you picture it? Such loyalty—and such a martyrdom?
<i>You</i> tell me, as a woman, is such a young
man not noble?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—[<i>Emphatically.</i>] Most noble!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—[<i>Rhetorically.</i>] Is he the sort of
young man who should be driven out? Is he the
sort who should be despised?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—Certainly not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—[<i>With increasing fervor.</i>] Is he the
sort who should be insulted? Who should be mistreated?
Who should be punished?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—God forbid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—[<i>Still more impassioned.</i>] Again I
ask you: Does such a young man deserve to be
driven away? To be insulted? To be mistreated?
Or does he deserve ... to ... what shall I say?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
... to ... I don’t know myself ... he deserves ...
to ... to——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—To be kissed!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Yes, that is just what happened to
him. [<i>Sinks weakly into a chair; mops his brow;
murmurs to himself.</i>] I thought she’d never say it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—[<i>Taken aback.</i>] Eh?... What happened
to him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Just what you said. Alexandra
kissed him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—Alexandra?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—As you said.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—I? Yes. Um, yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—After Albert insulted him she couldn’t
stand by and see him suffer any longer. She kissed
him, in mine and Albert’s presence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—And what did Albert do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—How could he, poor chap, understand
what was going on? Naturally, he didn’t see
it all as clearly as you see it now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—[<i>Without conviction.</i>] I? Yes ...
yes ... of course.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—And Beatrice ... who is such a
stickler for form ... sits here worrying herself
almost to death [<i>turns to <span class="smcap">Beatrice</span></i>] about something
which Dominica, as you see, finds perfectly
natural, yes, almost inevitable. Isn’t it so?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—[<i>Without conviction.</i>] Certainly,
certainly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—It was a charming gesture on Alexandra’s
part. I am truly proud that throughout
the entire episode she conducted herself just as you
yourself would have done. We may all be proud
of her. [<i>As he speaks <span class="smcap">Beatrice</span> gives him furtive,
grateful glances.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—A splendid girl. A girl of spirit!
[<i>Majestically.</i>] Happy the people who get such
a queen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>— ... And if you want to know—I
kissed the poor fellow myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—You were right. Louis XVI., after
his wife’s recovery from a dangerous confinement,
kissed a nurse. [<i>Emphatically.</i>] Such things happen.
[<i>After a brief pause.</i>] So that was the terrible
thing?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Yes, that was it. [<i>Points to <span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>.</i>]
She fainted dead away. But she ...
she was angry with the professor anyhow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—[<i>Quite reassured now.</i>] I? I look
upon it in the same light as Dominica does. Only
I wasn’t sure she would see it the way I did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—She is angry with the tutor on account
of Napoleon. He teaches the boys that——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—Can’t you bear him, either, this Napoleon?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—She loathes him!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—Dear, in my sainted husband’s library
there is a curiosity,—a little French book which
proves quite conclusively that Napoleon never lived.
I’ll send it to you. Read it. It is most comforting....
There ... dearest.... So that was
your tragic difficulty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Yes, you clever, practical darling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—Poor little tutor! Now he is beginning
to interest me. What is to become of him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—He is packing. Oh, he feels that,
after what has happened, he cannot stay on here
another moment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—He is quite right. But are you letting
him go like that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Well, you see, my dear ... he is now
... the poor fellow is now like an exploded cartridge.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—One must be very careful with cartridges.
It is just such people who become writers
of memoirs, American lecturers or publicists for the
opposition party. One cannot be too careful. I
have had painful experiences in such matters.
Tutors, adjutants.... I shall speak to him myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Thank you, you clever darling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—Had I been here I should have warned
you in the first place not to trifle with a tutor.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
A tutor near a princess is as dangerous as a lighted
match near a tin of gasoline. And, in any case,
there was no need for all this haste. Had you waited
one day more ... then I’d have been here. There
is an old English proverb which says: “Act in haste
and repent at your leisure.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—[<i>Significantly.</i>] In England!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—Now then ... when can I see this
tutor? [<i>The <span class="smcap">Chambermaid</span> enters at right.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—At once. Is everything ready?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chambermaid</span>—Yes, your highness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Send Cæsar to me here. [<i>The <span class="smcap">Countess</span>
and <span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span> enter at right.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—Everything is ready now, Dominica,
dear; and there is a surprise for you in there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—Nothing will surprise me now, dear
Symphorosa.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span>—This will, I think. Albert is awaiting
you in the drawing room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—Albert? Up this early? On <i>my</i> account!
You are right, dear. This is a most joyful
surprise. I’m coming. [<i>As she goes.</i>] Meantime,
bring this professor to me here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—I shall arrange it at once. But I am
afraid you will find him difficult.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—And I’ll wager that you won’t find
him difficult at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—Karl, I haven’t wagered since 1886,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span>
when I bet my sainted husband that I would give
birth to a boy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—And it was a girl?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—Two, Karl, two at a time. Come,
Countess. [<i>She exits at right. <span class="smcap">Symphorosa</span> and the

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—You have a good heart, Karl, and a
good head. [<i>Kisses him on the brow.</i>] There is but
one thing I am still afraid of——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—In heaven’s name, what now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—When she speaks to her son in there
... won’t he have a different opinion about it all?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—There are two reasons why he won’t
have a different opinion. In the first place, he won’t
be such a fool as to disagree with his mamma; and
in the second place, I mean to be present at the
interview. [<i>Starts to go.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—[<i>Hurries after him.</i>] Karl, dear ...
wait.... I have been very unfair to you....
What can I do to make you forgive me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—[<i>At the door, right.</i>] All I ask of
you is never to fall on my neck again. To-morrow
you will write those words in a copy book one hundred
times: “Old brooms sometimes sweep clean.”
[<i>He exits.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—No manners at all. [<i><span class="smcap">Cæsar</span> enters at
back.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Cæsar! You will go downstairs and
ask Dr. Agi if he will be good enough to come up
at once and wait in this room. Her highness, the
Princess Dominica wishes to speak to him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>—Very good, your highness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—What are you serving her highness
for breakfast?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>—Tea, cold salmon, cold beef, cold chicken
... cold....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Cæsar! Why, that is last night’s
supper....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>—I beg pardon, your highness. It is this
morning’s breakfast. I had it put on the table
at one this morning, and no one has eaten a bite
of it yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Have you lost your senses, Cæsar?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>—Quite likely, your highness.... Another
breakfast will be served.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Why are you so pale?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>—I didn’t sleep well, your highness. I suffered
agonies. Mostly on account of the tea.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—On account of what tea?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>—On account of the terrible mistake.
Father Hyacinth was served the hot tea and your
highness got the cold consommé.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—I am glad I did. I would have
fainted away in that horrible moment if I hadn’t had
that sip of ice-cold soup. It revived me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>—Thank you, your highness. You have
taken a great load off my mind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—You are not to punish the man who
made the mistake.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>—No, your highness. Perhaps you would
wish me to give him a little reward?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Let us not go to extremes.... The
professor is to wait here. [<i>She exits at right. <span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Has the princess arrived?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>—Yes, your highness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Where is she?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>—In there, your highness. [<i>Points to

her long motor ride.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—And what are you doing here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>—I have been told to summon—— [<i>Stops.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—To summon whom?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>—[<i>Reluctantly.</i>] Professor Agi.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>Sharply.</i>] What do they want of
Professor Agi?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>—He is to come up here and wait.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Very good. Send him up. [<i>She
sits.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>—But ... if your highness pleases ... I
am to send Mr. Agi up here to wait for——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Just do as you were told. Send
Professor Agi up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>—Yes, your highness. [<i>He exits at back.

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—What sort of costume is that you are
wearing?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—A travelling costume.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—You are going away?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Yes. [<i>There is a pause.</i>] Is there anything
your highness wanted?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—And what is to become of the boys?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—I don’t know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Aren’t you sorry to leave them?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Indeed.... I am very sorry. [<i>A pause.</i>]
Is there anything your highness wanted?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Princess Maria Dominica, the
mother of the Crown Prince, has come.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—I know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—And do you know why she has
come?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—I know that, too.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Well? [<i>A pause.</i>] Sit down, please.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Thank you. [<i>He does not sit.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>She rises.</i>] I haven’t spoken with
the Princess yet. I haven’t even seen her yet. Perhaps
within the next few minutes we shall meet. And
then ... she will tell me why she has come.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Yes. [<i>There is a pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Is that all you have to say about it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Practically.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—I don’t understand this mocking
tone!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Not mocking, only incredulous. I am not
a boy any more, to believe in fairy tales.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>With significance.</i>] ... Boy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Yes, your highness, not a boy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>Regarding him sternly, reproachfully.</i>]
What <i>is</i> this attitude you have assumed toward
me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—One of utmost deference, your highness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Why this pretense? Have you forgotten
what happened last night?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—I have forgotten, your highness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Have you? And have you also forgotten
what I——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—I have forgotten that, too, your highness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Was it so easy to forget?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—I didn’t say that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—If I had known——</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—You must have known.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—That you would forget?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—I ... must forget, and your highness must
deny it ... and ... <i>he</i> must not remember it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—He shall remember it, and I don’t
deny it. But I see that what I gave you was too
precious. More precious than you deserve. Perhaps
... a kingdom.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—That is not so precious. I know of one
that was offered in exchange for a horse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—You even insult me! You speak like
a sullen child.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—No, your highness ... what I am saying,
what I am doing, my departure to-day ... these
are my answer to your highness’ kiss.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—I hadn’t expected you to utter that
word.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Uttering it doesn’t hurt. The kiss itself
was much more painful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>Cuttingly.</i>] More painful for you
than for me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Oh, yes. It made me feel your profound
pity for me, and also your utter contempt. It was
a supercilious thing to do. It implied that I was
not a human being at all ... that I could be
treated ... like a child or a pet animal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Is that the way you took it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—If I hadn’t taken it like that——</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Then what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Then I should be kissing you still.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>Resentfully.</i>] I see it was all a
stupid mistake on my part.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—It was too much, your highness ... too
much at a time. That is why it was unconvincing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Unconvincing?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Yes. For we hadn’t reached that stage ...
and yet ... suddenly you had kissed me....
Afterwards ... I went out into the garden ...
and wandered about ... for a long time ... not
among the roses ... but out under the oaks where
the morning breeze was unscented and cool....
There ... at daybreak ... I grew calmer ...
and could weigh and consider.... And I felt like
a beggar into whose hat someone had tossed a thousand
crown note instead of a copper ... and who
must, in all honesty, run after the giver and offer
it back.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—I am glad to see that you know your
place so well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—It is morning, your highness. The sun is
shining.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—And not the stars.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—No, no; not the stars.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>Nervously.</i>] I am very glad of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—And I. Because you are glad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—I am very glad of it. It is better
like this.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—We can’t make it better. [<i>There is a brief
pause. <span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span> enters at right. <span class="smcap">Agi</span> bows.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Well, my son, at last you are here.
The Princess wants to talk to you. Yes, and the
Crown Prince, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—The Crown Prince?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—He would like to make amends for
... that unfortunate misunderstanding of yesterday.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Forgive me, father ... but I must ask
them to excuse me. I am leaving. My box is
already on the wagon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—And you proposed to leave us without
farewells?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—I have just said good-bye to her highness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Yes, and in a most extraordinary
way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—How?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Coldly. Sullenly. As if I had insulted
him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Well, isn’t that interesting? This is
the second time he has divined my thoughts. Yes,
you did insult him, my child. Certainly you hurt
his vanity ... perhaps also his self-respect ...
with that kindly little kiss. That is what you mean—isn’t
it, my son?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Yes, father.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—A tragic moment like that ... and
you call it a kindly little kiss!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—[<i>To <span class="smcap">Agi</span>.</i>] You have your athletic
habits to thank for this wisdom, this healthy clarity
of judgment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—And the things he said yesterday
... about his life and his death and his immortality....
Were they all untrue?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Don’t you see? Sudden anguish seeks
expression in the strongest language. That is why
common people, for instance, become profane in such
moments.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Is that all it meant?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—All? That is a great deal, my daughter,
for it manifests a profound sorrow. An exclamation
of pain, as it were, in which the words
are not important.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Which of his words shall I believe
then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—The ones he leaves unspoken now. [<i>A
brief pause.</i>] Well, and you, my daughter? Now!
Be candid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—I, Hyacinth?... If I am to be
candid, I believe I love him a little. [<i>Puts her head
on his shoulder.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—I myself thought you loved him ...
until you kissed him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—You say that, too? I don’t understand
any of you. Is there anything the matter
with me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—No, my child.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—And you don’t believe it was love
either?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—No, your highness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—But I——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—You don’t understand yourself, my
child. It was pity that stirred in you last night.
And at half past two it expressed itself in that
bitter kiss.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Bitter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—It wasn’t me you kissed, and yet I
know it was bitter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—I am very unhappy, Hyacinth. But
when you talk to me like this ... if you would
only stay on a day or two longer and keep talking
to me like this ... then I should feel better.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—I’ll stay, my child. I’ll stay three
days more to keep you cheerful; I’ll stay four
days——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Permit me to take my leave. [<i>Bows.</i>]
Your highness. [<i>Nervously takes leave of <span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>Cannot bring herself to let him go
like this.</i>] I admire your calm. Your mastery of
yourself. Yet I know you are only pretending.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span>
This isn’t what you’d like to do. [<i>She obstructs
<span class="smcap">Agi’s</span> way.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Perhaps not, your highness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—That isn’t what you’d like to say.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Perhaps not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—But ... if you can control yourself
so perfectly now, why didn’t you last night?
[<i>Angrily.</i>] That’s what I want to know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—I’ll stay a week.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>More and more hysterically.</i>] If
you can be so calm now, why weren’t you calm
then? Why did you do what you did? Why? Why?
What did you want?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—I don’t know. That is the strangest part
of what happened last night. I didn’t quite know
what I wanted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—You didn’t know?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—You didn’t know, and yet——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—My child ... be calm ... I’ll stay
a fortnight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>With growing indignation, unheeding
him.</i>] He didn’t know what he wanted ...
yet he dragged me along with him ... appealed to
my sympathy ... my credulity ... dragged me
and I clung to him ... ready for anything ...
even my own destruction ... even if the whole world
crumbled to pieces ... I would have clung to him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span>
... and ... he ... he—— [<i><span class="smcap">Albert</span> enters
quietly. She sees him but continues as if he were
not there.</i>] He didn’t know what he wanted ...
and didn’t care what harm he did ... as long as he
could gratify a momentary impulse ... he——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—[<i>With mild irony.</i>] Xara, you misjudge
him. He is a free spirit. He is not like us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>Unheeding him.</i>] He only wanted
to destroy everything ... to make a scandal....
Yes, he <i>was</i> ill-mannered and ignorant——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—You are unjust. He is an astronomer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—And now <i>I</i> say his conduct was impertinent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Your highness!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—Don’t answer her, Hans! I forbid it,
Hans! And if you will permit me ... Hans ... I
will kiss you, Hans. [<i>Embraces him and kisses him
on the cheek.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Bravo! I leave to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—[<i>Good-humoredly.</i>] Thanks, your highness.
You overwhelm me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—Do you mind?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Not this one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—Shall I kiss you again?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—Thanks, your kindness, that would be too
much. One was just enough. [<i><span class="smcap">Georg</span> and <span class="smcap">Arsen</span>
enter at back. Each carries a bouquet of flowers
in his hand. They pause a moment on the threshold,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span>
then come down to center, where they stand embarrassed.
<span class="smcap">Albert</span> goes down left.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georg</span>—Professor—— [<i>He is too touched to
speak; gives <span class="smcap">Agi</span> the flowers. So does <span class="smcap">Arsen</span>.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—For me? [<i>Takes them.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georg</span>—Yes. [<i>Turns away; wipes the tears from
his eyes. <span class="smcap">Arsen</span> hides his face against <span class="smcap">Georg’s</span>
shoulder.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agi</span>—There, now! Can these be—the Indians?
The celebrated Indians? [<i><span class="smcap">Georg</span> and <span class="smcap">Arsen</span> turn
and embrace him affectionately.</i>] We must have a
happy leavetaking. Not like this. Why, you ought
to be delighted. From now on—no more history lessons.
Now comes history itself. [<i>He bows, and
exits at back with the boys. There is a pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—Don’t be angry, Xara. I owed him
that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—In consolation for that kiss you gave
him yesterday. [<i><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span> looks suspiciously at
<span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Yes ... yes. It is true.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Well, then ... I was not to blame?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—No, my child.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—And I didn’t make an irreparable
blunder?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—That is almost impossible for one in
your social position.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>Mournfully.</i>] And I wasn’t a
heroine?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—No, my child.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—What was I then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Don’t ask, my child. [<i>There is a
brief pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—[<i>With ceremonious elegance.</i>] Alexandra ...
last night you made handsome amends
for a blunder of mine. I ask you now to stay at my
side through life. And when I am at fault be always
as ... as ... courageous as you were then. Will
you? [<i>Extends his hand to her.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>Gives him her hand. There is a
brief silence.</i>] Albert ... it is my duty to be quite
candid. If I tell you honestly that at this moment
I feel no other sentiment toward you than respect ...
and friendship——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—Then I answer you, Xara, that it suffices
me now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>Wistfully but kindly.</i>] We haven’t
contrived a love match, have we?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—No. No. Decidedly not. [<i>With each
“no” he shakes her hand.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—May I say what we have contrived instead?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—We have contrived ... something more
beautiful.... Love that comes after marriage.
The deeper and stronger happiness that ...
that——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—That comes later and endures longer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—Extraordinary that you can always express
one’s innermost thoughts so neatly. Think of
this: Katherine of Württemberg was the happiest
wife in the world. And yet hers was one of those
compulsory marriages which Napoleon—— [<i>Looks
around</i>] Napole.... But happy, you see, nevertheless.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>Sighs.</i>] Nevertheless. [<i>There it a
pause. <span class="smcap">Dominica</span> enters.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—My dear Alexandra. [<i>Embraces her.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Welcome, Aunt Dominica. [<i>Kisses
her hand with profound reverence.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—Tell me, my dears, hasn’t the professor
come yet?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Oh, yes; he was here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—And he has gone away. [<i>A long
silence.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—What does this silence mean? Why
don’t you speak? [<i>Another silence during which
<span class="smcap">Beatrice</span> enters.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—[<i>Regards the silent group; terror<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[308]</span>
seizes her; she cries out.</i>] Merciful heaven! Has
something happened again?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—The professor was kissed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—[<i>In alarm.</i>] By whom?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—By Albert.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—[<i>With a sigh of relief.</i>] Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—What does this mean? One after another,
you are all kissing this person. What sort
of man is he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—A most admirable man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—Did you kiss him, too?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Yesterday. But I shall kiss him
again before he goes away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—There appears to be no further need
for me to talk to him. The young man has had his
reward.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert</span>—It seems to me, mother, that a man who
had performed such a great service for the family
deserved it. Not only from the bride but also from
the bridegroom. [<i><span class="smcap">Dominica</span> nods assent.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>—Especially from the bridegroom.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—Quite right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice</span>—If he hasn’t gone yet ... perhaps
I ought to kiss him too ... what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—I fancy he has had enough. But I
shall kiss ... your daughter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—Dear Aunt ... if you deem me
worthy....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309"></a>[309]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—Entirely, my dear daughter, with only
this suggestion: That you remember now and again
that your sainted father used to call you his swan.
Think often of what it means to be a swan ...
gliding proudly ... majestically ... where the
moon gleams on the mirror of the water ... gliding
always in that purple radiance ... and never coming
ashore. For when a swan walks, my daughter
... when she waddles up the bank ... then she
painfully resembles another bird.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexandra</span>—[<i>Softly ironical at her own expense.</i>]
A goose?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominica</span>—Almost, my girl. Natural history
teaches that the swan is nothing but an aristocratic
duck. That is why she must stay on the mirror of
the water. She is a bird, but she may never fly.
She knows a song, but she may never sing until she is
about to die. Yes, dear, glide on the water ...
head high ... stately silence ... and the song—never!
[<i>There is a pause.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>—[<i>Entering at right.</i>] Breakfast is served.
[<i><span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span> proffers <span class="smcap">Dominica</span> his arm. Next goes
